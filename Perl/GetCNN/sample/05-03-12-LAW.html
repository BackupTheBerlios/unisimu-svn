Barnes told attorneys Thursday that he was concerned rape suspect Brian Nichols could pose a danger if he was convicted, the suspect's attorney said Friday evening.</b></p><p>The judge pledged to bolster security for the remainder of the trial after a sheriff's deputy found two makeshift weapons in Nichols' shoes on Wednesday.</p><p>The judge and two others were killed Friday after Nichols wrestled a gun away from a sheriff's deputy then went into a courtroom and shot Barnes and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau. (<a href="/2005/LAW/03/11/atlanta.shooting/index.html">Full story</a>)</p><p>As he escaped, Nichols fatally shot deputy Sgt. Hoyt Teasley, who was pursuing him outside the building. </p><p>Cynthia Hall, the deputy who was injured when Nichols overpowered her to steal her sidearm was in critical condition, but was expected to survive, said Jeffrey Salamone, attending trauma surgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital.</p><p>Police said the suspect carjacked at least five vehicles after he fled the Fulton County Courthouse.</p><p>Signs over Atlanta highways said police were looking for a green Honda Accord with a Georgia license plate 6584YN.</p><p>That car was found hours later in the same garage where a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution was assaulted and his car stolen after the shootings. The garage is a few blocks from the courthouse.</p><p>A search for Nichols is under way in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the Carolinas. </p><p>By Friday night, the reward for information leading to Nichols' capture was $60,000, and Atlanta police asked the public for help in locating him.</p><p>Nichols is described as being a black male, 33 years old, about 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighing 210 pounds.</p><p>Nichols' defense attorney, Barry Hazen, told CNN on Friday evening, &quot;It wasn't really a surprise because there had been an incident a couple days ago.&quot;</p><p>Hazen described how a sheriff's deputy had found the contraband in each of Nichols' shoes, raising concern about the danger he might pose.</p><p>&quot;The objects looked to be like heavy hinges, and one of them had a piece of material -- cloth -- strung through a hole in the object,&quot; he said.</p><p>The judge met with Hazen and prosecutors Thursday morning and &quot;everyone expressed concern about security,&quot; Hazen said.</p><p>&quot;Judge Barnes indicated to us that he was going to have security in the courtroom beefed up for the remainder of the trial,&quot; Hazen said. &quot;We were most concerned what reaction we would get if a jury were to convict him.&quot;</p><p>Two deputies were added to provide extra security in the courtroom. It was not immediately clear if they were in the courtroom Friday morning.</p><p>Hazen, who was not in the courtroom at the time of the shooting Friday, said he had only seen one additional deputy in court Thursday. &quot;I didn't get the sense that they were covering him any more closely than they had covered him before.&quot;</p><p>Asked if the judge had done anything that might have provoked Nichols, Hazen said he believed Barnes was &quot;giving him a very fair trial.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When there were objections that could have gone one way or the other way, they usually went Brian's way,&quot; Hazen said.</p><p>Nichols was on trial for charges of rape, aggravated sodomy, false imprisonment, aggravated assault with intent to rape, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and burglary against a woman he dated for more than seven years.</p><p>He was accused of binding his ex-girlfriend -- an executive at a Fortune 500 company -- with duct tape and assaulting her over a three-day period last fall. Howard also said Nichols brought a loaded machine gun into her home and threatened her, her family and her boyfriend.</p><p>Nichols had claimed the sex was consensual.</p><p>His first trial began two weeks ago, but ended in a hung jury. The second trial began Monday and the jury was expected to begin deliberations Friday afternoon.</p><p>&quot;I think he realized he might be convicted this time -- that he might not get a chance to walk out. And we believe he came with the intent of making sure that that didn't happen,&quot; Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters.</p><p>He faced a maximum sentence of life in prison, plus five years, if convicted.</p><p>Hazen, who has represented Nichols since December, said his client had &quot;never indicated to me that he was violent or that he would likely be violent toward me.&quot; The defense attorney said he had not yet arrived in the courtroom when the shooting occurred.</p><p>&quot;If the allegations are true, then he's capable of doing just about anything,&quot; he said.</p><a name="1"></a><a name="rv1"></a><h3>Jury foreman: State didn't prove case</h3><p>The jury foreman from the first trial told CNN that most jurors believed Nichols to be guilty, but prosecutors failed to prove their case.</p><p>&quot;There was a hung jury because the majority of us on the jury did not believe the state had proven to us beyond a reasonable doubt that the seven counts against him had occurred,&quot; said the foreman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>He said some jurors even contemplated writing Howard's office to &quot;express our frustration at how poorly both the police investigation and the district attorney's office had conducted the investigation and trial.&quot;</p><p>The foreman also said jurors were impressed by the suspect's appearance and intellect. &quot;He seemed like a pretty logical, intelligent, articulate person.&quot;</p><p>Nichols' only other criminal record was a misdemeanor count of burglary more than a decade ago.</p><p>Nichols briefly attended college at Kutztown University, about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he played linebacker on the school's Division II football team. He left the school after three semesters, heading for another college in his native South Carolina.</p><p>According to The Associated Press, Nichols' last known job was as a computer technician for a subsidiary of UPS. Company spokesman Norm Black told the AP that Nichols worked there between March and September 2004.</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 CNN.

Grace invites a public dialogue. You can respond to Grace by <a href="/feedback/forms/form5c.html?24">sending comments</a> to &quot;Nancy Grace.&quot;</i></p><p><b style="font-size:14px">ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Nancy Grace spoke with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer about Friday's deadly shootings at the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta. Grace was a Fulton County assistant district attorney and knew two of the victims, including Superior Court Judge Rowland W. Barnes.</b></p><p><b>GRACE:</b> I am heartbroken. I've been playing softball with Judge Barnes since 1987 since I was a rookie and the court reporter had just been up here visiting with me just the past couple of months, and I'm stunned. </p><p>Wolf, there were a million times we as prosecutors and judges walk into the courtroom going about our everyday business as public servants, and I am stunned. I am stunned about Judge Barnes' death and [the court reporter's] death and the two deputy sheriffs trying to do their job. Everybody keeps talking about how maybe there was an accomplice. </p><p>Listen, Wolf, anybody that's been in and out of that courthouse can figure out the lay of the courthouse. It is what it is. The man grabbed the gun and unloaded rather than go to jail on a rape charge. That's what happened.</p><p><b>BLITZER:</b> Talk a little bit about Judge Barnes, Nancy. Give us some personal thoughts that are going through your mind right now.</p><p><b>GRACE:</b> Wolf, I can't tell you how many times that I sat in the stands and cheered a softball game of Judge Barnes. He was a State Court judge for many, many years coming up in the ranks like all of us as a trial lawyer and, Wolf, when he made Superior Court judge, usually, you know, they are political hacks or appointees. This is a guy that everybody said, &quot;Thank God somebody like Barnes finally made the bench. This makes it all worthwhile.&quot; All I can say is Barnes was the kind of person that I was proud to practice in front of.</p><p><b>BLITZER:</b> You have to ask yourself, how can these things happen? How can such a tragedy occur to such a good man who worked so hard to do -- to do right in the courtroom? It's just such a painful experience, but it does raise the question of security for judges, security for court personnel, not only in Atlanta, Nancy, but all around the country. What needs to be done?</p><p><b>GRACE:</b> Wolf, so many times I've sat in the courtroom, and I've looked sitting there unarmed, of course, I was never armed in court. The deputies would have their guns, and we would have 20, 30, sometimes 50 violent offenders. They were not all shackled, and they were there in the courtroom. It is a risk that is being taken every day -- in every courtroom in this country.</p><p>And, Wolf, I just -- I just hate that it had to be Judge Barnes and his beautiful court reporter that had to pay this horrible, horrible price. And, Wolf, the judge has a girl. He has a beautiful girl, and I'm just -- to have your father killed in this way as a public servant. Wolf, this guy has tried so many cases. He was one of the most decent lawyers I have ever known and I'm stunned. I can hardly speak, Wolf.</p><p><b>BLITZER:</b> ... You're on the way to Atlanta right now?</p><p><b>GRACE:</b> Yes, Wolf, I was sitting on a flight to fly out to a victims' rights vigil in California at one airport, and I heard about Judge Barnes and my friend, the court reporter, and got up off the flight. I'm now in another airport coming to Atlanta, to the courthouse right now.</p><p><b>BLITZER:</b> So you're on the way to the scene of the -- of this crime?</p><p><b>GRACE:</b> Yeah, Wolf, I mean, my very dearest friend in the world is a defense lawyer who was on the calendar call this morning and standing in the back waiting to come into the courtroom when this shooting happened, and I just can't tell you how this has affected everyone, Wolf. </p><p>We go into court as lawyers, as prosecutors, as defense lawyers, as judges unarmed every day. I did it for 15 years, never believing that this would happen in a court of law, Wolf. </p><p>And all I can tell you now is of all the judges that sat on that bench, Barnes is one of the most decent men I have ever known, Wolf. I just can't stress enough. We take potshots at judges and defense lawyers and prosecutors. But, you know, there are a few of them walking around that make us proud to be lawyers, and that is what Rowland Barnes was.</p><p><b>BLITZER:</b> This comes only a couple weeks after the murder of a federal judge's husband and mother in Chicago, and we've been following that story closely, as you have, Nancy. It's going to raise questions around the country -- what needs to be done to secure these courtrooms, to secure court personnel, judges around the country? I assume every jurisdiction right now is taking a close look at their procedures.</p><p><b>GRACE:</b> Yeah, you know, Wolf, and the thing is, this is a fairly new facility with metal detectors and trained deputies. There are never inmates in a courtroom when there are not armed deputies. But the fact that this guy could get so close to the deputy -- I'm stunned -- and get the gun and unload in an open court of law. It's really a miracle more people were not shot because courtrooms are always full of spectators, witnesses, other defendants, victims, jurors. </p><p>This could have been a massacre on a much greater scale.</p><div class="cnnStoryContrib"><p><i>The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Nancy Grace. </i></p></div>

In his duties, he filled the role of gatekeeper for information about Mafia killings,The Associated Press reported.</p><p>Roslynn Mauskopf, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, described the men's actions as &quot;a stunning betrayal of their shields, their colleagues and the citizens they were sworn to protect.</p><p>&quot;For years, they were on retainer with the mob, they were paid handsomely for participating directly and indirectly in the murders and attempted murders of 11 individuals.&quot;</p><p>Among the charges against Caracappa and Eppolito are eight murders, two attempted murders and murder conspiracy.</p><p>Both men were placed on the payroll of Luchese family underboss Anthony &quot;Gaspipe&quot; Casso in 1987 and received $4,000 a month for acting as moles, prosecutors allege. In 1992, Caracappa and Eppolito accepted a $65,000 contract to eliminate Eddie Lino, a Gambino family captain whom Casso believed was involved in an attempt on his life, the indictment says.</p><p>Prosecutors also accuse Caracappa and Eppolito of having a role in the murders of three other men Casso believed tried to kill him. The duo also is charged in other killings.</p><p>Eppolito is the author of a book titled &quot;Mafia Cop.&quot; In the autobiography, he describes how he turned away from the &quot;family business&quot; to become what he described as one of the police department's most-decorated officers.</p><p>Eppolito has had small roles in several films, including the 1990 mob feature &quot;GoodFellas&quot; in which he played &quot;Fat Andy.&quot;</p><p>According to federal investigators, the former detectives still have mob ties.</p><p>New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, &quot;this shocking, disgraceful conduct demands prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.&quot;</p><p>Caracappa and Eppolito are each charged with eight murders, two attempted murders, one murder conspiracy, obstruction of justice, drug distribution and money laundering, according to a written statement issued by the U.S. attorney's office, Kings County district attorney's office, Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI.</p><p>If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p><p>Caracappa and Eppolito were charged with drug distribution and money laundering in Las Vegas, where they were arrested Wednesday night. They retired to Las Vegas several years ago.</p><p>For more than 10 years, authorities had suspected the men of Mafia involvement but lacked evidence. According to court documents, prosecutors obtained witness testimony and wiretapped conversations to make their case, the AP reported.</p><p>The pair had a federal court appearance in Las Vegas on Thursday, the AP reported. They did not enter pleas, and the hearing was postponed until Friday, the AP said.</p><p>Caracappa's lawyer David Chesnoff, speaking Thursday outside the court, said the government was using &quot;organized crime figures who are trying to save their lives&quot; to build their case. &quot;The government is relying on the words of rats,&quot; he said in an AP report.</p><div class="cnnStoryContrib"><p><i>CNN's Marie Lora contributed to this report.</i></p></div><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 CNN.

Defense attorneys have said they want to ask him about an incident in which the family of Jackson's accuser called the comedian seeking financial help to pay for the boy's cancer treatment.</p><p>Leno became suspicious about the call and contacted police, Jackson defense attorney Thomas Mesereau has said.</p><p>Attorneys for Leno had asked Melville to either clarify that the the gag order didn't prevent him from telling jokes about the case or modify it so that his Jackson humor could continue. While the decision was pending, he sidestepped any legal issues by bringing in guest stars to read his Jackson jokes, while he stood silently by.</p><p>The defense opposed Leno's motion, saying the gag order should apply to him as it applies to Jackson and all other witnesses and participants in the case.</p><p>&quot;We're not putting him out of business if he can't talk about Michael Jackson for a couple of weeks,&quot; said defense attorney Robert Sanger, who complained that Leno was &quot;making very cruel jokes about Michael Jackson.&quot; </p><p>Melville had earlier allowed another witness, ABC News journalist Martin Bashir, to go ahead with the broadcast of a special about Jackson, even though he was also subpoenaed to testify. Citing both of those instances, the defense complained that the gag order was being modified for witnesses but not for Jackson, putting him at a disadvantage.</p><p>Defense attorney Brian Oxman said Jackson has received numerous offers to make a rebuttal for money &quot;and he'd like to take advantage of all the offers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rebutting his critics is a prime way of making money (for Jackson),&quot; Oxman said.</p><p>The judge told the defense he could consider any request submitted by Jackson to make a rebuttal, noting that he has approved all of the defense's previous requests to let Jackson make statements concerning the case.</p><p>Melville slapped the gag order on all trial participants in an effort to contain the avalanche of media attention surrounding the high-profile case. Jackson and other participants must get approval from the judge before making statements.</p>

He told me he was almost 12,&quot; Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski told officials investigating prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. &quot;He told me his brother was there with him, but he really wanted to see his mother, could he please call his mother. He was crying.&quot;</p><p>Karpinski's statement is among hundreds of pages of Army records about Abu Ghraib the American Civil Liberties Union released Thursday. The ACLU got the documents under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking records about abuse of detainees in Iraq.</p><p>Karpinski did not say what happened to the boy in her interview with Maj. Gen. George Fay. Military officials have previously acknowledged that some juvenile prisoners had been held at Abu Ghraib, a massive prison built by Saddam Hussein's government outside Baghdad.</p><p>The transcript released Thursday is the first government document indicating that a child no older than 11 was held prisoner at Abu Ghraib.</p><p>Military officials have said that no juvenile prisoners were subject to the abuses captured in photographs from Abu Ghraib. However, some of the men shown being stripped naked and humiliated had been accused of raping a 14-year-old prisoner.</p><p>The documents released Thursday offer rare details about the children the U.S. military has held in Iraq. Karpinski said the Army began holding women and children in a high-security cellblock at Abu Ghraib in the summer of 2003 because the facility was better than lockups in Baghdad where they had been held.</p><p>The documents also include statements from six witnesses who said three interrogators and a civilian interpreter at Abu Ghraib got drunk one night and took a 17-year-old female prisoner from her cell. The four men forced the girl to expose her breasts and kissed her, the reports said. The witnesses -- whose names were blacked out of the documents given to the ACLU -- said those responsible were not punished.</p><p>Another soldier said in January 2004, troops poured water and smeared mud on the detained 17-year-old son of an Iraqi general and &quot;broke&quot; the general by forcing him to watch his son shiver in the cold.</p><p>On another subject, Karpinski said she had seen written orders to hold a prisoner that the CIA had captured without keeping records. The documents released by the ACLU also quote an unnamed Army officer at Abu Ghraib as saying military intelligence officers and the CIA worked out a written agreement on how to handle unreported detainees. An Army report issued last September said investigators could not find any copies of any such written agreement.</p><p>The Pentagon has acknowledged holding up to 100 &quot;ghost detainees,&quot; keeping the prisoners off the books and away from humanitarian investigators from the International Committee of the Red Cross. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has defended the practice, saying he authorized it because the prisoners were &quot;enemy combatants&quot; not entitled to prisoner of war protections.</p><p>The ACLU sued Rumsfeld earlier this month on behalf of four Iraqis and four Afghans who say they were tortured at U.S. military facilities. Rumsfeld and his spokesmen have repeatedly said that the defense secretary and his aides never authorized or condoned any abuses.</p><p>Six enlisted soldiers have pleaded guilty to military charges for their roles in abuses at Abu Ghraib, and Pvt. Charles Graner Jr. was convicted at a court-martial earlier this year and sentenced to ten years in prison.</p><p>Karpinski -- one of the few generals to be criticized in Army detainee reports for poor leadership -- quoted several senior generals in Iraq as making callous statements about prisoners.</p><p>Karpinski said Maj. Gen. Walter Wodjakowski, then the No. 2 Army general in Iraq, told her in the summer of 2003 not to release more prisoners, even if they were innocent.</p><p>&quot;I don't care if we're holding 15,000 innocent civilians. We're winning the war,&quot; Karpinski said Wodjakowski told her. She said she replied: &quot;Not inside the wire, you're not, sir.&quot;</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.

Barnes, court reporter Julie Ann Brandau and deputy sheriff Hoyt Teasley.</p><p>The nationwide manhunt for Nichols shifted focus late Friday with the discovery that the 1997 Honda Accord police had earlier thought was used for the getaway, was still in the garage where he carjacked it from a newspaper reporter after the courthouse shootings.</p><p>The garage's lower level exit gate, used only by parkers with monthly passes, was broken and detectives told CNN they believe Nichols crashed through it after taking another car on that level. </p><p>But they have not ruled out the possibility that he may have walked out of the garage.</p><p>A series of photos taken by two stairwell cameras show a shirtless Nichols putting on a jacket apparently taken from the reporter as he walked to a lower level and disappeared. </p><p>No camera was in position to capture what happened when Nichols exited the stairwell.</p><p>Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan says the fear now is Nichols may have taken another vehicle, and its owner as hostage, soon after abandoning the Honda.</p><p>&quot;That is of concern to us,&quot; Keenan said. &quot;We know that in the previous carjacking he had ordered the driver of the vehicle to get in the automobile that he was carjacking. We are very concerned that is a possibility that has happened.&quot;</p><p>There have been no missing person reports, Keenan said.</p><p>&quot;We do not know what type of vehicle he is now operating,&quot; Keenan said. &quot;We do not know how he left from here.&quot;</p><p>Keenan described the manhunt for Nichols as the largest in Georgian history.</p><p>But it was a private citizen who realized Friday night the 1997 Honda they were looking for was still in the Centennial garage, just blocks from the Fulton County Courthouse where the shootings occurred. It apparently had never been moved.</p><p>That garage was where a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the Honda was taken from him following the shootings.</p><p>The shootings occurred about 9 a.m., as Nichols was being led into an eighth-floor courtroom, Dreher said.</p><p>Nichols was being retried on rape, false imprisonment and other charges after a first trial last week ended in a hung jury. The second trial began Monday.</p><p>Nichols apparently overpowered a deputy in an elevator on their way to the courtroom, police said.</p><p>Jeffrey Salamone, attending trauma surgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital, said the deputy escorting Nichols suffered a graze wound from a gunshot.</p><p>Salamone said Cynthia Hall has a small bruise on her brain and some fractures around her face. She was in critical condition, but was expected to survive.</p><p>Once inside the courtroom, police said, Nichols held people in the room at bay briefly, then shot Judge Barnes and Brandau -- both of whom died at the scene.</p><p>Nichols then fled the building, where outside he shot Sgt. Teasley in the abdomen, officials said. The sheriff's deputy was pronounced dead at the hospital, Salamone said.</p><p>A witness told CNN Nichols took his tow truck at gunpoint near the courthouse.</p><p>The gunman &quot;told me to get out of the truck. I told him he can have the truck. And I walked away,&quot; Deronta Franklin said.</p><p>Atlanta police said they have set up a tip line at 404-730-7983 and 404-730-7984.</p><p>Law enforcement officials are offering rewards totaling $60,000 in the case.</p><a name="1"></a><a name="rv2"></a><h3>Courthouse security</h3><p>Some said the shooting was predictable given the security lapses at the courthouse.</p><p>&quot;The security in the Fulton County Courthouse, the way they deal with prisoners, is absolutely atrocious,&quot; attorney Dennis Scheib told CNN. &quot;I said this was going to happen.&quot;</p><p>Scheib said deputies outside the courthouse told him that a knife-like weapon was discovered in Nichols' boot last week.</p><p>Fulton County State Court Judge Craig Schwall, however, described security at the courthouse as &quot;phenomenal.&quot; Judges have their own private elevator, accessible only by key card, he said. Their chambers are heavily secured, he said, and they and other court officials have their own secure parking garage.</p><p>&quot;I think that, as public servants, we all have to be mindful of these risks,&quot; Schwall said.</p><p>&quot;The only thing I can imagine is that someone would have had to have moved very quickly and suddenly to catch one of the deputies off guard in order to remove his weapon,&quot; said attorney B. J. Bernstein.</p><a name="2"></a><a name="rv1"></a><h3>Well-respected judge</h3><p>Bernstein told CNN that Judge Barnes, who presided over civil and criminal cases, was &quot;extremely highly thought of in the legal community.&quot; </p><p>Last month, Barnes made headlines when he ordered a 34-year-old woman, who had seven children and pleaded guilty to killing the eighth, a newborn, to undergo sterilization.</p><p>He was a vocal advocate of Fulton County's supervised rehabilitation clinics, an alternative for jail for repeat offenders with drug addictions. Barnes touted the program for its cost-effectiveness.</p><p>A juror in Nichols' trial told CNN that Barnes was kind, and said Nichols always seemed to be respectful to him.</p><div class="cnnStoryContrib"><p><i>CNN's Steve Brusk, Ninette Sosa and Randi Kaye contributed to this report. </i></p></div>
