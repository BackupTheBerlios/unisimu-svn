She's played by Melissa Gilbert, 40, who was young Laura Ingalls in &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot;</p><p>In case you hadn't noticed, Hallmark likes nostalgic casting.</p><p>&quot;People know (Wagner's) name, whether from 'The Bionic Woman,' or commercials, or the movies she's done,&quot; says Al Dickerson, producer of the movie that airs 9 p.m. EST Saturday.</p><p>He says the casting fit because &quot;like the woman she plays, Lindsay's very close to the earth, and has very strong feelings about these issues.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm a country girl really at heart,&quot; says Wagner, who was born in Los Angeles but &quot;introduced to real intense nature&quot; when her family moved to Oregon.</p><p>She lived awhile in Montana, but she now has a home in Calabasas, north of Los Angeles, about 20 minutes from the ranchland where the movie was filmed.</p><p>Her main house is under construction, so over a cup of tea she chatted in the guest house where her mother lives.</p><p>Asked what can be done to help wild horses, Wagner replies: &quot;That we care. That's what can be done about anything. If we collectively as a culture care about anything -- whether it's AIDS or domestic violence or the extinction of wild horses -- that is what is going to fix anything.&quot;</p><p>Wagner thinks her career has lasted in part because when she chooses a role, &quot;I care very much about the resonance that my work has with the audience. I care about offering them something rather than just trying to get their attention to make money ... that's why much of what I do are true stories, because I believe so much in people being able to transcend their circumstances.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thicker Than Water&quot; is not a true story, but the 30-plus TV movies Wagner has starred in include many real life dramas such as &quot;This Child is Mine&quot; and &quot;The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story.&quot;</p><p>As an &quot;emotionally inaccessible&quot; child, Wagner took acting classes prescribed by a family friend. It was &quot;something fun to do,&quot; but also helped heal her &quot;hurting inside.&quot;</p><p>She received some job offers as a teenager but decided to wait. &quot;I was off being a hippie.&quot; Then at 22, &quot;I just woke up one day and said, 'It's time.' &quot;</p><p>It happened to be during an actors' strike in Hollywood and casting agents had time on their hands to see newcomers. So when the cameras turned again on &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.,&quot; Wagner scored a role as a nurse.</p><p>&quot;I had about four lines, but I ad-libbed to about 12,&quot; she laughs.</p><p>Universal immediately gave her a contract. She guest-starred in many of the studio-produced series, one of which was &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man.&quot;</p><p>Introduced to boost ratings as a love interest for Lee Majors' Steve Austin, Wagner's Jaime Sommers was made bionic to give her life after a skydiving accident, but her body rejected the bionics and she died.</p><p>Fans were outraged. Letters flooded in, complaining that a potentially &quot;quintessential female role model&quot; had been killed off so arbitrarily.</p><p>So Universal sought to restore Sommers to cyborg life, first in another episode of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man,&quot; and then in her own &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; series.</p><p>&quot;They started chasing me -- which is wonderful,&quot; recalls Wagner, who had opted out of her Universal contract to pursue feature work. &quot;Eventually I said, 'Hey, why not.' I was doing acting therapy with kids at the time and I realized this way I can talk to millions of kids.&quot;</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "04/10/2005";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">NEW YORK (AP)  -- The irony has not escaped Lorraine Bracco.</b></p><p>For five seasons as psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi on HBO's &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; the actress has battled mob boss Tony Soprano's mental demons. But for a year and a half in real life, Bracco was fighting clinical depression with medication and therapy.</p><p>&quot;If you break your leg, you have it fixed,&quot; Bracco, 50, recently told The Associated Press. &quot;If you have a toothache, you go to the dentist. When it comes to mental health, people tend to think they can just get over it.&quot;</p><p>Bracco's ready to talk about her fight with depression in hopes of knocking out stigmas about antidepressants and their effects. The mother of two went to drug manufacturer Pfizer in hopes of getting the word out, which she'll do with a Web site (www.depressionhelp.com goes live on Tuesday) and a series of commercials.</p><p>&quot;I don't blame anything or anyone,&quot; said Bracco. &quot;I think it was lack of education about medication. I thought if I need medication, I must be really sick.&quot;</p><p>Bracco acknowledges she wasn't feeling too keen after battling for custody of daughter Stella with ex-husband and actor Harvey Keitel, dealing with Stella's juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and declaring bankruptcy after splitting with actor Edward James Olmos.</p><p>&quot;I just had a lot of really big things that kept pounding me and I would let all these things rule my life instead of my dreams and wishes,&quot; said Bracco. &quot;I was doing everything. I was being a good mommy. The laundry was done. They had food. They were driven to school and extracurricular activities, but I was joyless in it. It just became a chore for me.&quot;</p><p>Looking back, Bracco said she was dealing with depression for over a decade. It wasn't until 1997, after she'd been cast in &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; that she followed the suggestion of a friend to seek professional help.</p><p>&quot;I was very afraid to go on any kind of medication because I was afraid it was going to dull me, which is not true,&quot; said Bracco. &quot;I think a lot of people think you'll become a zombie.&quot;</p><p>But antidepressants didn't hinder Bracco's performance in &quot;Sopranos,&quot; and she eventually escaped the depression.</p><p>&quot;I was on the medication for a year and a half and went into the doctor's office and said, 'I don't really need this anymore,' &quot; said Bracco. &quot;I haven't been taking it for five years, six years.&quot;</p><p>If the story ended here, it'd be a happy ending for Bracco. She bought a house in the Hamptons. Stella's in college. Bracco goes back to shooting the sixth season of &quot;Sopranos&quot; in April. And she's been dating 30-year-old former Syracuse University basketball player Jason Cipolla for almost three years.</p><p>&quot;A good relationship doesn't hurt anybody,&quot; said Bracco. &quot;Let's be fair, younger or older. That's been very nice for me.&quot;</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "-1";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">(Entertainment Weekly) -- Bruce Willis' new movie &quot;Hostage&quot; -- in which he plays a police negotiator who must save two families (one of them his own) from menacing thugs -- appears to borrow from several of his career highlights. </b></p><p>Of course, Willis first rescued hostages in 1988's &quot;Die Hard,&quot; and then again in its two sequels. After that, he famously protected a young boy (like &quot;Hostage's&quot; Jimmy Bennett) in 1999's &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; And he's shaved his head before, most dramatically for 1995's &quot;Twelve Monkeys.&quot;</p><p>The actor, who turns 50 on March 19, seems to be returning to safe territory after five years without a box office winner. (His last was 2000's hitman comedy &quot;The Whole Nine Yards.&quot;) He's even planning a fourth &quot;Die Hard.&quot; </p><p>Yet some of his biggest successes have been his riskiest choices, where he's played against type. Who, after all, expected the light-comedy star of TV's &quot;Moonlighting&quot; to excel as an action hero in &quot;Die Hard&quot;? Once he became an A-lister in big-budget blockbusters, who expected him to triumph by working for scale in the low-budget &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994)? Who knew he could serve as the quiet center of a psychological horror film (1999's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;) and help make it one of the top-grossing movies of all time? And who knew he could turn right around and successfully spoof his tough-guy image in &quot;Nine Yards&quot;?</p><p>Initially known for his perpetual smirk, Willis has made a career out of surprising moviegoers with his versatility. After &quot;Hostage,&quot; he'll make another left turn by appearing in an ensemble role in the visually innovative comic-book movie &quot;Sin City,&quot;due in April. Whether or not these movies are hits, Willis has become such an established role model that Hollywood will continue to grant him opportunities to stretch. </p><p>In the meantime, take a look at the <a href="/linkto/ew/031105.html" target="new">following gallery</a> to see how he's surprised us over the years.</p><p><a href="/linkto/ew/031105.html" target="new">Click here to see the gallery.</a></p>
