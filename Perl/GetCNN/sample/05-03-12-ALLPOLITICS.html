Paul Sarbanes, a liberal Democrat who is the longest serving senator in Maryland's history, announced Friday that he won't seek a sixth term next year.</b></p><p>&quot;It was not my ambition to stay there until they carried me out,&quot; Sarbanes said during an afternoon news conference at his Baltimore office. &quot;It was just the right time. We think we've served long and well and honorably and we're very comfortable with this decision.&quot;</p><p>Sarbanes, 72, was elected to the Senate in 1976. He said health was not a factor but added he did consider his age in making his decision.</p><p>He is a reliable liberal vote on economic and social issues, although he has often been upstaged by Maryland's other senator, the outspoken Barbara Mikulski, who was elected in 1986.</p><p>Sarbanes becomes the second Democratic incumbent to retire rather than run again. Among Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee has long indicated he does not plan to seek a new term.</p><p>Sarbanes moved to the Senate after a career in the House that included a seat on the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate impeachment hearings involving former President Richard Nixon.</p><p>His principal area of interest in the Senate has been the Banking Committee, where he has served as chairman or senior Democratic member for several years.</p><p>A retirement could also have repercussions in another high-profile race in Maryland next year. Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich is expected to seek re-election, and several Democratic challengers have begun maneuvering for the nomination to oppose him.</p><p>Sarbanes said he made the announcement early to give other Democratic candidates a chance to start their campaigns. He declined to speculate on who would run for his seat, but said he expected a Democrat would win.</p><p>&quot;We've a number of very able Democrats... I'm confident that one of them will be elected to the United States Senate in 2006 and I will do everything I can to bring around that result,&quot; he said.</p><p>Among Democrats mentioned as Sarbanes' possible replacement is former NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, who served five terms in the House before heading the civil rights organization.</p><p>The state traditionally votes Democratic, and went for John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "-1";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There's an old saying that a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth puts its boots on.</b></p><p>Let it be known that mistakes can travel just as fast -- and just as far.</p><p>Take the case of Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-California, who at a hearing on Capitol Hill last week spoke about a 1962 nuclear test in the Nevada desert.  The test was code named &quot;Project Sedan.&quot; </p><p>Tauscher's remarks were little noticed, until they were transcribed -- incorrectly -- in an unofficial transcript of the hearing. One letter was changed. The &quot;Sedan&quot; nuclear test became the &quot;Sudan&quot; nuclear test.</p><p>And the government of Sudan took notice.</p><p>Less than a day after Tauscher uttered her words, and after they were incorrectly transcribed, Sudanese officials evidently were alerted to the transcript. </p><p>The Sudanese Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires in Khartoum and demanded an explanation about the supposedly secret nuclear tests in the east African country.</p><p>The Arab language satellite channel Al-Jazeera picked up the story. It put the Sudanese foreign minister on the air. &quot;The Sudanese government takes this issue seriously and with extreme importance,&quot; he told the world.</p><p>The Chinese news service picked up the story. In a story appearing only one day after Tauscher spoke, the news service reported that the Sudanese government held the U.S. responsible for &quot;cancer spread in Sudan&quot; caused by &quot;U.S. nuclear experiments in the African country in 1962-1970.&quot;</p><p>The quickly evolving story got little notice in the United States.</p><p>At the offices of the Federation of American Scientists, however, government watchdog Steven Aftergood was reviewing the CIA public translations of overseas newscasts, and came upon the story.</p><p>&quot;I thought, Wow!,&quot; said Aftergood. &quot;Here's a historical revelation that will cause the history books to be rewritten. No one's ever heard of a U.S. nuclear test in the Sudan in 1962.&quot;</p><p>Aftergood went to work. He tracked down the transcript of a March 2 House Armed Services subcommittee hearing during which the 43-year-old nuclear secret was supposedly revealed.</p><p>Aftergood read Tauscher's comments about a 1962 test involving a 100 kiloton blast that displaced 12 million tons of earth and dug a crater 320 feet deep. He noted that the transcript referred to it as the Sudan nuclear test site, but quickly recognized that the blast described was identical to the &quot;Project Sedan&quot; test -- which was conducted to determine if nuclear devices could be used for peaceful purposes such as cratering or earth moving. </p><p>&quot;So somehow the notion that the U.S. had conducted a nuke test in Sudan had gotten into the news food chain and had triggered alarms on the part of the Sudanese government,&quot; Aftergood said.</p><p>Now comes the job of rectifying the error.</p><p>A State Department official told CNN that U.S. officials have explained the mix-up to the Sudanese.</p><p>And Tauscher this week issued a terse statement: &quot;When speaking at a March 2 briefing ... I referred to nuclear testing that occurred on July 6, 1962, at the Nevada Test Site code named 'Sedan.' I was not referring to the African country Sudan.&quot;</p><p>For Aftergood, this is a cautionary tale.</p><p>&quot;It is an amazing demonstration of the way information flows in our world today and how it has enormous potential to mislead as well as inform,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, the changing of a single letter altered the meaning from a meaningless code name into a foreign country with repercussions that are still unfolding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think the saving grace in this case was that the concern expressed by the Sudanese government was not classified. They didn't say, 'We have a secret source that has informed us that there was a nuclear explosive test in 1962.' The fact that they laid it out on the table at least makes it possible to correct it in a matter of a day.&quot;</p><p>So corrections, like mistakes, also can travel with warp speed, although they rarely do.</p><p>Take, for instance, the lead of this story. While the old saying about &quot;lies&quot; is often attributed to Mark Twain, Twain scholars say it did not originate with him. They attribute it to another wit.</p><p>But that truth is just getting its boots on.</p>
