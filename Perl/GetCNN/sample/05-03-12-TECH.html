Is a PDP display the same as a plasma TV? And what exactly is plasma, anyway?</p><p>More cutting-edge technology such as Internet phones -- Voice over IP or VoIP in the industry dialect -- is generally followed by a string of acronyms.</p><p>It's probably a good thing that the phone supports SDP, RTP and RTCP. But do you really need VAD, CNG, NAT traversal and STUN? What if you just want to pick up the handset and dial?</p><p>And is a system that provides &quot;WORM archival functionality&quot; really trustworthy? Aren't computer worms bad?</p><p>The problem is hardly new. A standard for extension cards for laptops, commonly called PCMCIA, was derided as &quot;People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms&quot; when it launched. It actually stands for &quot;Personal Computer Memory Card International Association.&quot;</p><p>It is a real problem for consumers, however, who have to make sure that their new DVD player -- next to plain-vanilla DVDs -- supports DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, CD, MP3 and JPEG.</p><p>If a player is missing one of those, a disc might simply not play.</p><p>To top if off, one of two new, mutually incompatible formats will be built into players within the next year -- Blu-ray and HD-DVD.</p><p>It could be argued that some of the energy (&quot;powered by vision,&quot; of course) poured into prototypes of cutting-edge technology could be used to perfect English translations of German descriptions.</p><p>&quot;If the reduction of vibrations, undesired deformations and noise is desired at maximum economy, safety and comfort, Adaptronics is a key technology for the future and becomes a factor for success in many branches,&quot; informs a helpful leaflet distributed by CeBIT's so-called &quot;future market.&quot;</p><p>The telephone industry isn't doing much better.</p><p>An employee of electronics group Philips recently took her GSM-GPRS mobile phone to South Korea, but could not get onto the CDMA network there. Or was it the CDMA-2001X EV/DO standard that was incompatible with her phone?</p><p>She must now decide whether to upgrade to a UMTS model -- a standard that will be outdated as networks are upgraded with higher-speed HSDPA technology next year, with another HSUPA upgrade already waiting in the wings.</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 <a href="/interactive_legal.html#Reuters">Reuters</a>.

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "-1";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">(SPACE.com) -- While NASA's shuttle Discovery crew prepares to return to flight, engineers and technicians are packing the mission's crucial cargo of fresh supplies and science equipment.</b></p><p>As part of NASA's first return to flight mission, Discovery's STS-114 spaceflight is bound for the International Space Station (ISS) to deliver food, tools and replacement parts that can't be shipped to the orbital laboratory any other way.</p><p>NASA engineers are filling the Raffaello multi-purpose logistics module (MPLM) -- a sort of high-tech shipping container for space station supplies -- with cargo to be used by Expedition 11 crewmembers Sergei Krikalev and John Phillips, who will be serving aboard the ISS when Discovery arrives.</p><p>&quot;It's a fairly light load for an MPLM because of all the other things we're flying on the mission,&quot; said NASA's Scott Higginbotham, ISS mission manager for the STS-114 mission.</p><p>To enhance Discovery's safety, shuttle engineers have equipped the orbiter with a 50-foot (15-meter) boom to extend the reach of its shuttle arm, and a number of sensors to track impacts along its wing leading edges.</p><p>&quot;We're [also] taking up a lot of tools and equipment in the mid-deck,&quot; said veteran astronaut Eileen Collins, STS-114 commander, during an orbiter check-out earlier this year.</p><p>Collins said Discovery will also carry enough food and other supplies to support its crewmembers for a &quot;period of time&quot; aboard the ISS in the remote chance the orbiter suffers severe damage.</p><p>Discovery's STS-114 mission is currently set to launch no earlier than May 15 this year. It is slated to be the first shuttle launch since the February 1, 2003, loss of Columbia and its seven astronauts. Since that accident, the ISS has depended on Russian Progress cargo ships for vital supply shipments.</p><a name="1"></a><a name="rv2"></a><h3>Packing Raffaello</h3><p>Built by the Italian Space Agency, Raffaello is one of four cargo modules designed to ferry cargo to the ISS aboard space shuttles. Each module is designed to hold 16 racks of cargo and fits inside the shuttle's payload bay where it can be attached to the ISS, then emptied from the inside.</p><p>Higginbotham said Raffaello will only carry 12 racks of supplies totaling about 2,600 pounds (1,170 kilograms) when Discovery launches toward the ISS.</p><p>But tucked inside the module will be the Human Research Facility rack 2 (HRF-2), a science station designed to boost biomedical research capabilities of the ISS. The HRF-2 rack, which was packed into Raffaello earlier this week, will be installed inside the station's U.S.-built Destiny laboratory.</p><p>&quot;For me, one of the high points is the internal build up of the space station with new laboratory equipment,&quot; said Phillips, ISS Expedition 11 flight engineer, during an interview.</p><a name="2"></a><a name="rv1"></a><h3>Space station gyros and platforms</h3><p>Discovery's crew will deliver one major piece of hardware that has been long-awaited by astronauts and managers working with the International Space Station.</p><p>A 620-pound (281-kilogram) device called a control moment gyroscope (CMG) will ride up aboard Discovery to be installed at the ISS during a spacewalk. The gyroscope will replace a failed component and help keep the space station oriented properly. STS-114 spacewalkers Soichi Noguchi and Stephen Robinson will install the CMG during the second spacewalk of their mission.</p><p>During their third extravehicular activity (EVA), the two astronauts will attach a 1,522-pound (690-kilogram) platform to the exterior of the space station's Quest airlock to hold on-orbit spare parts that will arrive aboard the next two shuttle flights, NASA officials said.</p><p>While the Raffaello cargo will only be partially full at liftoff, the STS-114 crew will spare no space loading it up for the return to Earth.</p><p>&quot;We're bringing back a lot of Russian hardware that is used for automated docking,&quot; Higginbotham said. &quot;There are a lot of U.S. items that we want to bring back either to repair and reuse again or to analyze and understand why they failed. &quot;</p><p>Higginbotham said the cargo module will be stuffed with 5,200 pounds (2,358 kilograms) of broken or unused equipment, dirty clothes and other material that is currently clogging up space aboard the ISS.</p><p>NASA astronaut Michael Fincke, who served aboard the ISS for six months during Expedition 9 mission, said returning the shuttle fleet to flight is critical for the U.S. to regain its space self-sufficiency.</p><p>&quot;The space station is just full of things waiting to come back down to the planet,&quot; he told SPACE.com.</p>

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "-1";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">(SPACE.com) -- The White House confirmed Friday that President Bush has nominated Mike Griffin, head of the space department at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) to be the next NASA Administrator.</b></p><p>Griffin, a rocket scientist with an MBA, had previously worked at NASA as the agency's associate administrator for exploration in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the first President Bush. Word of Griffin's nomination had first been reported earlier in the day by SPACE.com's sister publication Space News.</p><p>At present, veteran shuttle astronaut Frederick Gregory is sitting in as NASA's interim administrator. Former chief administrator Sean O'Keefe resigned in December, citing personal and financial reasons for his decision. O'Keefe took a job as chancellor of Louisiana State University's Baton Rouge campus. He served three years as NASA's chief.</p><p>Before returning to APL in April 2004 to head the space work, Griffin worked as the chief operating officer of In-Q-Tel, a private non-profit enterprise funded by the Central Intelligence Agency to invest in companies developing leading edge technologies.</p><p>According to an April 20, 2004 press release from APL, Griffin had worked at APL in the 1980s, when he helped design the successful Delta 180 series of missile-defense technology satellites for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDI).</p><p>After leaving APL in 1986, he served as the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization's deputy for technology.</p><p>After departure from the SDI work, Griffin served as both the chief engineer and associate administrator for exploration at NASA Headquarters, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>In addition to a doctorate in aerospace engineering, Griffin holds master's degrees in aerospace science, electrical engineering, applied physics, civil engineering and business administration, and a bachelor's degree in physics.</p><p>House Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) and Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA) praised Griffin's nomination in a written statement.</p><p>&quot;We are extremely pleased that the President has nominated Mike Griffin to be NASA Administrator&quot; Boehlert said in the statement. &quot;Dr. Griffin has long been a resource to the Science Committee, both as a public witness and in providing private counsel. He has broad expertise, knows NASA inside and out, and is an imaginative and creative thinker and leader. He is also known for his candor and directness. We look very forward to working with Dr. Griffin at this critical time for NASA.&quot;</p><p>Griffin recently took part in an independent study for The Planetary Society on strategy for the proposed U.S. space exploration policy as outlined by President George W. Bush.</p><p>That study in which Griffin was a co-team leader was issued in July 2004 and titled: &quot;Extending Human Presence into the Solar System.&quot; That assessment looked at a multi-stage approach that included initial need to utilize existing space shuttle components to create a heavy-lift launch capability.</p><p>Griffin has a doctorate degree in aerospace engineering and five master's degrees: aerospace science, electrical engineering, applied physics, civil engineering and business administration.</p>
