Two other terrorist suspects had already been released on similar bail terms, one on Thursday.</p><p>Just hours after the new law was passed, the Home Office (Interior Ministry) said &quot;control orders,&quot; the central component of the legislation, would be imposed immediately on the eight men -- described by the government and Britain's most senior police officer as a serious threat to society.</p><p>The new control orders would be similar to the tough bail terms that had been set -- that they wear electronic tags, stay home for 12 hours a day and refrain from pre-arranged meetings.</p><a name="1"></a><a name="rv1"></a><h3>Suspects all Muslims</h3><p>The suspects, all foreign Muslims, included Abu Qatada, a Syrian cleric who the government describes as the spiritual mentor to Mohammed Atta, leader of the hijackers who attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001.</p><p>Qatada has been accused of funding and inspiring militants worldwide from his base in London. He was arrested in October 2002 after disappearing in the weeks after September 11.</p><p>The government accuses him and the other suspects of having links to al Qaeda via militant Muslim groups.</p><p>&quot;We are talking about individuals where there is a very substantial risk to the people of this country,&quot; Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Charles Clarke said in Friday's heated debate over the content of the new anti-terrorism legislation.</p><p>&quot;It is for that reason that it is important that we have the powers which are set out [in the bill], and I stand by them.&quot;</p><p>Blair wanted to get his bill approved this week because Britain's existing anti-terrorism laws, rammed through in the wake of the September 11 attacks, are due to expire on Sunday.</p><p>But opponents, many from within his own Labour Party, said the bill was poorly drafted and draconian. They also complained they had not had time to debate it properly.</p><p>Blair made concessions to get his way in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, but the unelected Lords, who by convention are expected to yield to the Commons, refused to back down.</p><p>In an extraordinary game of parliamentary ping-pong, the two houses batted the bill back and forth. Each time they did so, a parliamentary official wearing a wig carried the bill through the elegant corridors from one chamber to the other.</p><p>The deadlock was eventually broken when Blair made his final concession and opposition Conservative leader Michael Howard accepted it.</p><p>Both men, flexing their political muscles before a general election expected in May, claimed victory.</p><p>&quot;We've got the substance of what we were asking for,&quot; said Howard, adding he had forced Blair into a major climbdown.</p><p>The new law will allow authorities to detain Britons as well as foreigners indefinitely and without charge if it suspects them of terrorism. The old law applied only to foreigners.</p><p>The new measures will also allow the government to place suspects under house arrest.</p><p>Both the old and new laws require Britain to suspend the right to a fair trial guaranteed under European law, making it the only country to do so.</p><p>Opponents of the legislation say that goes against 800 years of British tradition, dating from the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215.</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 <a href="/interactive_legal.html#Reuters">Reuters</a>.

The commission invited imams to condemn terrorism at Friday prayers. </p><p>The fatwa said that according to the Koran &quot;the terrorist acts of Osama bin Laden and his organization al Qaeda ... are totally banned and must be roundly condemned as part of Islam.&quot; (<a href="/2005/WORLD/europe/03/10/spain.fatwa.osama.ap/index.html">Full story</a>)</p><p>The action took place on the eve of the first anniversary of the country's worst-ever terror attack -- which many observers have coined as Europe's 9/11, a reference to the al Qaeda attacks on the United States in 2001. </p><p>More than 1,500 people were injured when 10 backpack bombs exploded on packed commuter trains on March 11, 2004.</p><p>Spanish authorities mainly blame Islamic terrorists and there were claims of responsibility in the name of al Qaeda. Many of the 74 suspects charged in the case lived in Spain -- but were originally from Morocco, a predominately Muslim country.</p><p>But the only person sentenced so far is a teenage Spaniard facing six years for transporting explosives used in the attack.</p><a name="1"></a><a name="rv1"></a><h3>Royal tribute</h3><p>Spaniards lit candles, laid flowers and observed a long, mournful silence Friday to mark the first anniversary of the terrorist attack.</p><p>King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia led government leaders and other dignitaries during the main memorial -- a silent, five-minute vigil inaugurating a grove of 192 olive and cypress trees, one for each person killed last March 11 and a policeman killed when Islamic militant suspects seeking to avoid arrest blew themselves up.</p><p>The grove in Madrid's main park has been christened the &quot;Forest of the Absent.&quot;</p><p>After the vigil, a young cellist dressed in black played &quot;Song of the Birds&quot; by Pablo Casals, a piece the late Spanish composer and musician had dedicated to peace.</p><p>As the dignitaries stood in silence, much of Spain paused in remembrance.</p><p>Trains made unscheduled stops at stations, and people stopped in the street to grieve over an attack that cut across nationality, killing immigrants from Ecuador to Ukraine, from France to the Philippines.</p><p>Earlier, at the rail stations targeted in the attack, people huddled together and shed tears as memories of the blasts returned. Some left notes that tried to put pain into words.</p><p>&quot;Who will give me back my will to live, which died here a year ago?&quot; read a letter posted on a wall at El Pozo station -- the deadliest of four scenes of carnage. It was signed only Susana, a woman who said she was injured when bombs gutted a double-decker train.</p><p>As dawn broke, bells at hundreds of churches around Madrid tolled for five minutes beginning at 7:37 a.m., when the first of 10 dynamite-loaded backpacks detonated on four rush-hour trains. Al Qaeda-linked militants claimed responsibility. </p><p>Even now, images of Spain's tragedy are hard to bear. And memories still haunt the survivors. (<a href="/2005/WORLD/europe/03/10/madrid.chance/index.html">Full story</a>)</p><p>A year on, broken families still meet in Madrid's main square to share their torment, and tears.</p><p>Mothers like Rita, who moved to Spain from Ecuador to give her son, Jose Luis, aged 11, a better life.</p><p>&quot;Our hope was that he would become a professional: a doctor or a lawyer. We thought he'd have a better chance here, a better future. But we were wrong. We brought him to his death,&quot; she said.</p><p>There are still many question marks, such as who exactly ordered the bombing.</p><p>Just three days after the train bombings, the Spanish government -- allied with Washington over Iraq -- was voted out of office.</p><p>The new administration withdrew its troops and is urging diplomacy for the future -- a stance more in tune with the feelings of many in Madrid.</p><div class="cnnStoryContrib"><p><i>CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this report</i></p></div><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 CNN.

Security Council if the Iranians fail to fulfill their international agreements, including a promise to halt uranium enrichment. </p><p>&quot;I am pleased that we are speaking with one voice with our European friends,&quot; U.S. President Bush told a crowd in Shreveport, Louisiana. </p><p>&quot;I look forward to working with our European friends to make it abundantly clear to the Iranian regime that the free world will not tolerate them having a nuclear weapon.&quot; </p><p>But a senior Iranian negotiator in nuclear talks with the European Union, Cyrus Naseri, dismissed the U.S. move as a mere gesture, saying &quot;it is too ridiculous to be called an offer.&quot; </p><p>&quot;It is like trading a lion for a mouse,&quot; he told CNN. &quot;Would the United States be prepared to give up its own nuclear fuel production against a cargo of pistachios delivered in truckloads?&quot; </p><p>Pistachios are an Iranian export. </p><p>He said the U.S. deciding not to oppose Iran's entrance into the WTO &quot;is really not something so significant that we could even discuss it as a tradeoff for anything at all.&quot; </p><p>The European countries were already obligated by treaty to pursue Iran entrance into the WTO, he said, calling it &quot;in the interest of Europe as much as it is in the interest of Iran.&quot; </p><p>And, he added, Iran is negotiating with the European countries, not with the United States, and &quot;what we are negotiating is that we will pursue our nuclear fuel production, which is aimed for our own nuclear power generation, and that it will be monitored properly by IAEA so it will not be diverted for military purposes.&quot; </p><p>Iran maintains that its nuclear program, which it is building with Russian assistance, is solely for the production of nuclear energy and that it has no plans to use it to build nuclear weapons. </p><p>But the Bush administration -- skeptical that oil-rich Iran really has a burning need for nuclear power -- believes Iran is trying to cloak a covert nuclear weapons program in the guise of a civilian program. </p><p>The United States has refused to enter the European negotiations with Iran, which President Bush branded in 2002 as part of the &quot;axis of evil.&quot; </p><p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced the U.S. policy shift in a statement, saying it was being done &quot;in order to support the European diplomacy. </p><p>The United States will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, the licensing of spare parts for Iranian civilian aircraft, in particular from the European Union to Iran, she said. </p><p>&quot;The key here was to establish with our European allies a common agenda, a common approach to the issue of getting the Iranians to live up to the international obligations which they have undertaken,&quot; she told reporters in Washington. </p><p>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday that &quot;the point, I think, for Iran is they do have an opportunity.&quot; </p><p>&quot;They have an opportunity here if they're willing to take it,&quot; he said. </p><p>In a letter to the European Union updating the status of the talks with Iran, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said &quot;while progress is not as fast as we would wish, we believe we are moving in the right direction.&quot; </p><p>&quot;We should have at least preliminary results to show from the negotiations in the period ahead,&quot; said the letter, co-signed by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. </p><p>However, if Iran does not fulfill its international commitments, including ceasing nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities, then &quot;we shall have no choice but to support referring Iran's nuclear program to the U.N. Security Council&quot; -- a move which the United States has been pushing. </p><p>The European leaders said they were &quot;united in our determination that Iran should not acquire a nuclear weapons capability&quot; and &quot;remain committed to pursuing all diplomatic means to resolve the outstanding issues through negotiation.&quot; </p><p>They are offering Iran incentives, including support for energy programs and economic assistance. </p><p>The United States has insisted that any offer of incentives must also include clear consequences if Iran refuses the offer. </p><p>According to the European negotiators, the Iranians are seeking a number of trade-related incentives, including reducing Iran's trade deficit with Europe, gaining easier access to export licenses and technology transfers and encouraging more European companies to import Iranian goods. </p>

That is the simple message from the report published today,&quot; said Blair, unveiling the findings of his Africa Commission.</p><p>The 400-page report calls on the international community to immediately double foreign aid to Africa to $50 billion and make fighting AIDS a priority. It sets 100 percent debt cancellation as a goal and urges rich nations to drop trade barriers that hurt poor countries.</p><p> It also says African leaders must move faster toward democracy, stamp out corruption and take other steps to improve how their countries are run.</p><p>Blair hopes the report will be embraced around the world as a blueprint for an African renaissance. He has made helping Africa a key priority for Britain's presidencies of both the powerful Group of Eight wealthiest nations and the European Union this year.</p><p>&quot;In a world where prosperity is increasing and more people sharing each year in this growing wealth, it is an obscenity that should haunt our daily thoughts that 4 million children in Africa will die this year before their fifth birthday,&quot; Blair added, calling for a new partnership between the developing world and Africa.</p><p>Africans and others working to solve the continent's deep troubles say the challenge now is to implement the report's recommendations.</p><p>&quot;Unless we deliver, it'll just be another report,&quot; said Myles Wickstead, the director of the Commission for Africa.</p><p>The 17 members of the Commission for Africa, chaired by Blair and including Live Aid activist and musician Bob Geldof and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, have acknowledged that other high profile efforts to rescue Africa have foundered. </p><p>But they hope the report will muster concerted international action in a year that governments and aid agencies say is a make or break year for the continent.</p><p>&quot;This report can be a rallying call for a generation that will no longer tolerate the obscenity of extreme poverty in Africa -- or it could end up gathering dust,&quot; said Adrian Lovett of the anti-poverty group Oxfam. </p><p>&quot;It's now up to world leaders to rise to the challenge, to take long-overdue action and make this a breakthrough year for Africa.&quot;</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.
