An emphasis will be placed on learning the lyrics to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We want to remind all Americans to cherish our national treasures and to celebrate our unity and our values in song,&quot; said John Mahlmann, executive director of the National Association for Music Education, an organization of music teachers from preschool to graduate school.</p><p>The association is leading the effort and getting help from a variety of musicians, organizations and lawmakers and first lady Laura Bush, who is serving as honorary chairperson.</p><p>The effort kicked off Thursday on the west lawn of the Capitol with a performance of the anthem led by The Oak Ridge Boys and hundreds of school kids.</p><p>Schools across the country will be taking part in the project, and special performances of the anthem will be held.</p><p>&quot;I remember learning the anthem in elementary school,&quot; Sue Ellen Parrott, 64, of Potomac, Maryland, said after reciting the first verse of the song -- verbatim. &quot;It's the same way you learn a language -- when you're around it, you hear it, you say it and eventually it sticks.&quot;</p><p>Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, was among those attending the kickoff. He said the project also seeks to draw attention to the need to keep school music programs vibrant.</p><p>&quot;Music is one of the easy things to eliminate because of budget cuts, but it's important to give kids the avenue to express themselves,&quot; Poe said. &quot;We need to get kids singing about our history again.&quot;</p><p>Francis Scott Key wrote the words to the anthem during the War of 1812. On the night of September 13, 1814, Key watched the British Navy attack Fort McHenry near Baltimore. Key was expecting to find Baltimore under British control the next day, but what he saw was a battered American flag still waving as the sun rose.</p><p>He wrote a poem, and the words were later put to an old English drinking song, &quot;To Anachreon in Heaven,&quot; which had been composed by John Stafford Smith for the 18th-century Anachreontic Society. In 1931 President Hoover signed an act making the song the official national anthem.</p><p>The anthem has four verses, but the first one is the one usually sung at events.</p><p>&quot;The official standards for our anthem specifically state that the song was meant to be sung together,&quot; Mahlmann said, &quot;but now many Americans don't even know the words to the song or which song is the official anthem.&quot;</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.

</p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">var clickExpire = "04/10/2005";</script><p><b style="font-size:14px">CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) -- The businessman who won the nation's richest undivided lottery jackpot was sued Friday by the father of a teenager who died of a drug overdose at his home in September.</b></p><p>The wrongful death lawsuit said Jesse Joe Tribble was led astray by Jack Whittaker's late granddaughter, and it said he should have exercised more control over her since she was in his custody.</p><p>Whittaker promised to fight the case by Tribble's father, Jimmy Tribble. &quot;I'll be dead and gone to hell before he gets a dime out of me,&quot; Whittaker said.</p><p>Tribble, 18, was found dead September 17 at Whittaker's home in Scott Depot.</p><p>The night before, according to the lawsuit, Tribble had used drugs at the home with 17-year-old Brandi Bragg. When Tribble passed out on a bed, the lawsuit said, Bragg left him there instead of seeking medical help, though &quot;she knew he was severely intoxicated and ill from the use of illegal drugs.&quot;</p><p>Bragg died less than three months later. The cause of death has not been determined.</p><p>The lawsuit accused Whittaker of negligence, saying he knew or should have known that Bragg was using money he gave to her to buy illegal drugs and supply her friends with drugs. </p><p>It said he continued to spoil her with money, automobiles and unlimited access to his home even after she developed &quot;a serious drug habit.&quot;</p><p>Whittaker disputed the claims, saying it was Tribble who bought drugs for Bragg and that surveillance tapes show Bragg left the house hours before Tribble died.</p><p>Trouble has dogged the already-wealthy Whittaker since he won the $314.9 million Powerball jackpot on Christmas Day 2002, taking his winnings in a $113 million lump sum. </p><p>Among the problems, Whittaker was arrested twice for drunken driving, and his home and his vehicles have been hit with a rash of break-ins.</p><br clear="all"><hr size="1" noshade style="color: #999;width:464px;"><div class="cnnStoryContrib">Copyright 2005 The <a href="/interactive_legal.html#AP">Associated Press</a>.
