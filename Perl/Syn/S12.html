<p>A class is a module declared with the <code>class</code> keyword.  As with
modules, the public storage, interface, and name of the class is
represented by a package and its name, which is usually (but not
necessarily) a global name.</p>
<p>Taken as an object, a class represents all of the possible values of
its type, and the class object can thus be used as a proxy for any
``real'' object of that type in calculating what a generic object of
that type can do.  The class object is an Object, but it is not a
Class, because there is no mandatory Class class in Perl 6.  We wish
to support both class-based and prototype-based OO programming.
So all metaprogramming is done through the current object's <code>META</code>
object, which can delegate metaprogramming to any metamodel it likes.
However, by default, objects derived from Object support a fairly
standard class-based model.</p>
<p>There are two basic class declaration syntaxes:</p>
<pre>
    class Foo;          # rest of file is class definition
    ...</pre>
<pre>
    class Bar {...}     # block is class definition</pre>
<p>The first form is allowed only as the first declaration in a compilation
unit (that is, file or eval string).</p>
<p>In either case, the code represented by <code>...</code> executes at compile
time as the body of a method of the metaclass, which is responsible
for interpreting the keywords of the class definition.  (And since a
class is also a module, it also handles any module-oriented keywords.
You can export subs from a class at ``use'' time, for instance.)</p>
<p>A named class declaration can occur as part of an expression, just like
named subroutine declarations.</p>
<p>Classes are primarily for instance management, not code reuse.
Consider using <code>roles</code> when you simply want to factor out
common code.</p>
<p>Perl 6 supports multiple inheritance, anonymous classes, and autoboxing.</p>
<p>All public method calls are ``virtual'' in the C++ sense.  More
surprisingly, any class name mentioned in a method is also considered
virtual, that is, polymorphic on the actual type of the object.</p>
<p>You may derive from any built-in type, but the derivation of a low-level
type like <code>int</code> may only add behaviors, not change the representation.
Use composition and/or delegation to change the representation.</p>
<p>Since there are no barewords in Perl 6, bare class names must be
predeclared.  You can predeclare a stub class and fill it in later
just as you would a subroutine.  Alternately, you can define a local
class or type variable using the <code>::</code> type sigil.  In an rvalue
context the <code>::</code> prefix is a no-op, but in a declarational context,
it binds a new type name within its declared scope.</p>
<p>Without a <code>my</code> or other scoping declarator, a bare <code>class</code>
declarator declares an <code>our</code> declarator, that is, a name within
the current package.  Since class files begin parsing in the <code>*</code>
(<code>GLOBAL</code>) package, the first class declaration in the file installs
itself as a global name, and subsequent declarations then install
themselves into the current class rather than the global package.</p>
<p>Hence, to declare an inner class in the current package (or module, or
class), use <code>our class</code> or just <code>class</code>.  To declare a lexically
scoped class, use <code>my class</code>.  Class names are always searched
for from innermost scopes to outermost.  As with an initial <code>::</code>,
the presence of a <code>::</code> within the name does not imply globalness
(unlike in Perl 5).  So the outward search can look in children
of the searched namespaces.</p>
<p>Class traits are set using <code>is</code>:</p>
<pre>
    class MyStruct is rw {...}</pre>
<p>An ``isa'' is just a trait that happens to be another class:</p>

<pre>
    class Dog is Mammal {...}</pre>
<p>MI is specified with multiple <code>is</code> modifiers:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog is Mammal is Pet {...}</pre>
<p>Roles use <code>does</code> instead of <code>is</code>:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog is Mammal does Pet {...}</pre>
<p>You may put these inside as well:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog {
        is Mammal;
        does Pet;
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>Every object (including any class object) delegates to an instance of
its metaclass.  You can get at the metaclass of any object via the
<code>META</code> method.  A ``class'' object is just considered an ``empty''
instance in Perl 6, more properly called a ``prototype'' object.
The actual class object is the metaclass object pointed to by the
<code>META</code> syntax.  So when you say ``Dog'', you're referring to both a
package and a prototype object, that latter of which points to the
actual object representing the class via <code>META</code>.  The prototype
object differs from an instance object not by having a different
type but rather in the extent to which it is defined.  Some objects
may tell you that they are defined, while others may tell you that
they are undefined.  That's up to the object, and depends on how the
metaclass chooses to dispatch the .defined method.</p>
<p>The notation <code>^Dog</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>Dog.META</code>, so <code>^</code> can be
considered the ``class'' sigil when you want to talk about the current
metaclass instance.</p>
<p>Classes are open and non-final by default, but may easily be closed
or finalized not by themselves but by the entire application, provided
nobody issued an explicit compile-time request that the class stay open
or non-final.  (Or a site policy could close any applications that use
the policy.)  Platforms that do dynamic loading of sub-applications
probably don't want to close or finalize classes wholesale, however.</p>
<p>Roles take on some of the compile-time function of closed classes,
so you should probably use those instead anyway.</p>
<p>A private class can be declared using <code>my</code>; most privacy issues are
handled with lexical scoping in Perl 6.  The fact that importation
is lexical by default also means that any names your class imports
are also private by default.</p>
<p>
<a href="#__index__"><small>Back to Top</small></a>
</p>

<h1><a name="Methods">Methods</a></h1>
<p>Methods are routines declared in a class with the <code>method</code> keyword:</p>
<pre>
    method doit ($a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit ($self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit (MyName $self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit (::?CLASS $self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }</pre>
<p>Declaration of the invocant is optional.  You may always access the
current invocant using the keyword <code>self</code>.  You need not declare the
invocant's type, since the lexical class of the invocant is known in any
event because methods must be declared in the class of the invocant,
though of course the actual (virtual) type may be a derived type of
the lexical type.  You could declare a more restrictive type, but
that would probably be a bad thing for proper polymorphism.  You may
explicitly type the invocant with the lexical type, but any check for
that will be optimized away.  (The current lexically-determined class
may always be named as <code>::?CLASS</code> even in anonymous classes or roles.)</p>
<p>To mark an explicit invocant, just put a colon after it:</p>
<pre>
    method doit ($x: $a, $b, $c) { ... }</pre>
<p>This is true also for multi methods:</p>
<pre>
    multi method doit ($x: $a; $b; $c) { ... }</pre>
<p>Private methods are declared using <code>my</code>:</p>
<pre>
    my method think (Brain $self: $thought)</pre>
<p>(Such methods are completely invisible to ordinary method calls, and are
in fact called with a different syntax that uses <code>!</code> in place of the <code>.</code>
character.  See below.)</p>
<p>To call an ordinary method with ordinary method-dispatch semantics,
use either the dot notation or indirect object notation:</p>

<pre>
    $obj.doit(1,2,3)
    doit $obj: 1,2,3</pre>
<p>Indirect object notation now requires a colon after the invocant if
there are any arguments.  If there are no arguments and you omit the
colon, the notation is parsed either as a named unary operator or a
list operator with one argument.  In any case, all of these come out
to the same thing:</p>
<pre>
    $handle.close
    close($handle)
    close $handle:
    close $handle</pre>
<p>To explicitly reject method call and only consider subs, put a
trailing comma after the single positional argument:</p>
<pre>
    close($handle,)</pre>
<p>Dot notation can omit the invocant if it's in <code>$_</code>:</p>
<pre>
    .doit(1,2,3)</pre>
<p>It can use a simple scalar variable for the method name:</p>
<pre>
    $obj.$methodname(1,2,3)</pre>
<p>You must use a special syntax to call a private method:</p>
<pre>
    $mybrain!think($pinky)</pre>
<p>Parentheses (or a colon) are required on the dot notation if there
are any arguments (not counting adverbial arguments).  There may be
no space between the method name and the left parenthesis unless you
use the dot form of parentheses:</p>
<pre>
    .doit       # okay, no arguments
    .doit()     # okay, no arguments
    .doit ()    # ILLEGAL (two terms in a row)
    .doit.()    # okay, no arguments, same as .doit()
    .doit\ .()  # okay, no arguments, same as .doit() (long dot form)</pre>
<p>However, you can turn any of the legal forms above into a list
operator by appending a colon:</p>
<pre>
    .doit: 1,2,3        # okay, three arguments
    .doit(1): 2,3       # okay, one argument plus list
    .doit (): 1,2,3     # ILLEGAL (two terms in a row)
    .doit.(1): 2,3      # okay, same as .doit(1,2,3)
    .doit\ .(1,2): 3    # okay, same as .doit(1,2,3)</pre>
<p>In particular, this allows us to pass a closure in addition to the
``normal'' arguments:</p>
<pre>
    .doit: { $^a &lt;=&gt; $^b }              # okay
    .doit(): { $^a &lt;=&gt; $^b }            # okay
    .doit(1,2,3): { $^a &lt;=&gt; $^b }       # okay</pre>
<p>In case of ambiguity between indirect object notation and dot form,
the nearest thing wins:</p>
<pre>
    dothis $obj.dothat: 1,2,3</pre>
<p>means</p>
<pre>
    dothis ($obj.dothat(1,2,3))</pre>
<p>and you must say</p>
<pre>
    dothis ($obj.dothat): 1,2,3</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
    $obj.dothat.dothis: 1,2,3</pre>
<p>if you mean the other thing.</p>
<p>Also note that if any term in a list is a bare closure or pointy
sub, it will be considered to be the final argument of its list
unless the closure's right curly is followed immediately by comma
or comma surrogate.  In particular, a method call does *not* extend
the list, so you can say:</p>
<pre>
    @list.grep: { $_ % 2 }.map: { $_ - 1 }.say</pre>
<p>and that will be taken as equivalent to</p>
<pre>
    @list.grep({ $_ % 2 }).map({ $_ - 1 }).say</pre>
<p>Methods (and subs) may be declared as lvalues with <code>is rw</code>.  You can
use an argumentless <code>rw</code> method anywhere you can use a variable,
including in <code>temp</code> and <code>let</code> statements.  (In fact, you can use an
<code>rw</code> method with arguments as a variable as long as the arguments are
used only to identify the actual value to change, and don't otherwise
have strange side effects that differ between rvalue and lvalue usage.
Setter methods that expect the new value as an argument do not fall
into the well-behaved category, however.)</p>
<p>Method calls on mutable scalars always go to the object contained in
the scalar (autoboxing value types as necessary):</p>
<pre>
    $result = $object.doit();
    $length = &quot;mystring&quot;.codes;</pre>
<p>Method calls on non-scalar variables just calls the <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>
or <code>Code</code> object bound to the variable:</p>
<pre>
    $elems = @array.elems;
    @keys  = %hash.keys;
    $sig   = &amp;sub.signature;</pre>
<p>Use the <code>VAR</code> pseudo-function on a scalar variable to get at its
underlying <code>Scalar</code> object:</p>
<pre>
    if VAR($scalar).readonly {...}</pre>
<p>There's also a corresponding postfix:&lt;VAR&gt; macro that can be used
as if it were a method:</p>
<pre>
    if $scalar.VAR.readonly {...}</pre>
<p>(But since it's a macro, <code>VAR</code> is not dispatched as a real method.)</p>
<p>You can also get at the container through the appropriate symbol table:</p>
<pre>
    if MY::&lt;$scalar&gt;.readonly {...}</pre>
<p>
<a href="#__index__"><small>Back to Top</small></a>
</p>

<h1><a name="Class20methods">Class methods</a></h1>
<p>Other OO languages give you the ability to declare ``class'' methods that either don't
need or actively prohibit calls on instances.  Perl 6 gives you a choice.
If you declare an ordinary method, it can function as a ``class'' method when you
pass it a prototype object such as ``Dog'' regardless of how defined the prototype
object is, as long as the method body doesn't try to access any information that
is undefined in the current instance.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can associate a class method with the current metaclass instance,
which as a singleton object knows your package, and can function as a more traditional
``class'' method:</p>
<pre>
    our $count;
    method ^count { return $count }</pre>
<p>Such a <em>metaclass method</em> is always delegated to the <code>META</code> object just as methods like
<code>.does</code> are, so it's possible to call this as <code>Dog.count</code> or <code>$dog.count</code>.
However, best practice is probably to call such a class method as <code>Dog.^count</code>
or <code>$dog.^count</code> to make it clear that it's in its own namespace separate
from ordinary methods, and so that your class method cannot be accidentally
overridden by an ordinary method in a subclass--presuming you don't want to
allow for that possibility.</p>

<h1><a name="Submethods">Submethods</a></h1>
<p>Submethods are for declaring infrastructural methods that shouldn't
be inherited by subclasses, such as initializers:</p>
<pre>
    submethod BUILD ($arg) {
        $.attr = $arg;
    }</pre>
<p>Apart from the keyword, submethod declaration and call syntax is
identical to method syntax.  You may mix methods and submethods of
the same name within the class hierarchy, but only the methods are
visible to derived classes via inheritance.  A submethod is called
only when a method call is dispatched directly to the current class.</p>
<p>[Conjecture: there is some relationship between ``submethod BUILD'' and
``method ^BUILD'' that possibly rises to the level of a unifiable identity...]</p>

<p>Attributes are stored in an opaque datatype, not in a hash.  Not even
the class has to care how they're stored, since they're declared much like
ordinary variables.  Instead of <code>my</code>, use <code>has</code>:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog is Mammal {
        has $.name = &quot;fido&quot;;
        has $.tail is rw;
        has @.legs;
        has $!brain;
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>Public attributes have a secondary sigil of ``dot'', indicating
the automatic generation of an accessor method of the same name.
Private attributes use an exclamation to indicate that no public accessor is
generated.</p>

<p>The ``true name'' of the private variable always has the exclamation, but
much like with <code>our</code> variables, you may declare a lexically scoped alias
to the private variable by saying:</p>
<pre>
        has $brain;     # also declares $!brain;</pre>
<p>And any later references to the private variable within the same block
may either use or omit the exclamation, as you wish to emphasize or
ignore the privacy of the variable.  Outside the block, you must use
the <code>!</code> form.  If you declare with the <code>!</code> form, you must use that
form consistently everywhere.  If you declare with the <code>.</code> form, you
also get the private <code>!</code> form as a non-virtual name for the actual
storage location, and you may use either <code>!</code> or <code>.</code> form anywhere
within the class, even if the class is reopened.  Outside the class
you must use the public <code>.</code> form, or rely on a method call (which
can be a private method call, but only for trusted classes).</p>
<p>For public attributes, some traits are copied to the accessor method.
The <code>rw</code> trait causes the generated accessor to be declared <code>rw</code>,
making it an lvalue method.  The default is a read-only accessor.</p>

<p>You may write your own accessors to override any or all of the
autogenerated ones.</p>
<p>The attribute variables may be used within instance methods to refer
directly to the attribute values.  Outside the instance methods, the
only access to attributes is through the accessors since an object has
to be specified.  The dot form of attribute variables may be used in
derived classes because the dot form always implies a virtual accessor
call.  Every <em>dot</em> declaration also declares a corresponding private
<em>exclamation</em> storage location, and the exclamation form may be used
only in the actual class, not in derived classes.  Reference to the
internal storage location via <code>$!foo</code> should generally be restricted
to submethods.  Ordinary methods should stick to the <code>$.foo</code> form.</p>
<p>Because <code>$.foo</code>, <code>@.foo</code>, <code>%.foo</code>, <code>&amp;.foo</code> are just shorthands of
<code>self.foo</code> with different contexts, the class does not need to declare
<code>has $.foo</code> as an attribute -- a <code>method foo</code> declaration can work
just as well.</p>
<p>The dot form can take an argument list as well.  These are all equivalent:</p>
<pre>
    self.foo(1,2,3);    # a regular method call
    self.foo.(1,2,3);   # ditto
    $.foo(1,2,3);       # calls self.foo under $ context
    $.foo.(1,2,3);      # ditto
    @.foo(1,2,3);       # calls self.foo under @ context
    @.foo.(1,2,3);      # ditto</pre>
<p>Pseudo-assignment to an attribute declaration specifies the default
value.  The value on the right is evaluated at class composition
time, that is, while the class is being compiled and the class
object constructed.  However, if the default value is a closure,
that closure will be executed later at object initialization time.
(Use a double closure to initialize to a closure value.)  The topic
of the closure will be the attribute being initialized, while ``self''
refers to the entire object being initialized.</p>

<p>All classes inherit a default <code>new</code> constructor from <code>Object</code>.  It
expects all arguments to be named parameters initializing attributes of
the same name.  You may write your own <code>new</code> to override the default,
or write constructors with any other name you like.  As in Perl 5,
a constructor is any routine that calls <code>bless</code>.  Unlike in Perl 5,
you call it as a method on the class object (though any object may be
used as a class object), passing the candidate as the first argument.
To bless a hash as in Perl 5, say:</p>
<pre>
    $object = $class.bless({k1 =&gt; $v1, k2 =&gt; $v2, ...});</pre>
<p>If the candidate is omitted, a candidate object is implicitly created in
the current class by calling <code>CREATE</code>:</p>
<pre>
    $object = $class.bless(k1 =&gt; $v1, k2 =&gt; $v2, ...)
    $object = $class.bless(:k1($v1), :k2($v2), ...)  # same</pre>
<p>(The default <code>CREATE</code> makes an opaque object.)</p>
<p>All arguments to this form of <code>bless</code> must be named arguments, not
positional.
Hence, the main purpose of custom constructors is to turn positional
arguments into named arguments for <code>bless</code>.  The <code>bless</code> method
allows an object to be used for its class invocant.  (Your constructor
need not allow this).  In any case, the object is not used as a prototype.
Use <code>.clone</code> instead of <code>.bless</code> if that's what you mean.</p>
<p>Any named arguments to <code>bless</code> are automatically passed to the
<code>CREATE</code> and <code>BUILD</code> routines.  If you wish to pass special options
to the <code>CREATE</code> routine (such as an alternate representation),
call <code>CREATE</code> yourself and then pass the resulting candidate to <code>.bless</code>:</p>
<pre>
    my $candidate = $class.CREATE(:repr&lt;P6opaque&gt;);
    $object = $class.bless($candidate, :k1($v1), :k2($v2))</pre>
<p>For the built-in default <code>CREATE</code> method, <code>P6opaque</code> is the default
representation.  Other possiblilities are <code>P6hash</code>, <code>P5hash</code>,
<code>P5array</code>, <code>PyDict</code>, <code>Cstruct</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>bless</code> function automatically calls all appropriate <code>BUILD</code>
routines by calling the <code>BUILDALL</code> routine for the current class,
which initializes the object in least-derived to most-derived order.
<code>DESTROY</code> and <code>DESTROYALL</code> work the same way, only in reverse.</p>
<p>The default <code>BUILD</code> and <code>BUILDALL</code> are inherited from <code>Object</code>, so
you need to write initialization routines only if you wish to modify
the default behavior.  If the name of a named argument begins with a
<code>::</code> and corresponds to a class or role being built, the list value
of that argument is passed as a list of named arguments to that class
or role's <code>BUILD</code>.  (If the value of that argument is a closure
instead of a list, that closure will be called to return a list.
The argument to that closure will be the name of the class currently
being initialized.)  In the absence of a class-labeled pair, all
the arguments to <code>bless</code> are passed to the <code>BUILD</code>.</p>

<h1><a name="Calling20sets20of20methods">Calling sets of methods</a></h1>
<p>For any method name, there may be some number of candidate methods
that could handle the request: typically, inherited methods or
multi variants.  The ordinary ``dot'' operator dispatches
to a method in the standard fashion.  There are also ``dot'' variants
that call some number of methods with the same name:</p>
<pre>
    $object.meth(@args)   # calls one method or dies
    $object.?meth(@args)  # calls method if there is one, otherwise undef
    $object.*meth(@args)  # calls all methods (0 or more)
    $object.+meth(@args)  # calls all methods (1 or more)</pre>
<p>Any method can defer to the next candidate method in the list by
saying <code>next METHOD</code>.  Any method can stop the progression by saying
<code>last METHOD</code>.  The order and selection of the candidates may be
specified by arguments to a pseudo-class known as <code>WALK</code>:</p>
<pre>
    $object.*WALK[:breadth:omit($?CLASS)]::meth(@args);</pre>
<p>The <code>WALK</code> pseudo-class takes these arguments:</p>
<pre>
    :canonical      # canonical dispatch order
    :ascendant      # most-derived first, like destruction order
    :descendant     # least-derived first, like construction order
    :preorder       # like Perl 5 dispatch
    :breadth        # like multi dispatch</pre>
<pre>
    :super              # only immediate parent classes
    :method&lt;name&gt;       # only classes containing method declaration
    :omit(Selector)     # only classes that don't match selector
    :include(Selector)  # only classes that match selector</pre>
<p>In addition to <code>next METHOD</code>, the special function <code>call</code> dispatches
to the next candidate, possibly with a new argument list:</p>
<pre>
    call;           # calls with the original arguments
    call();         # calls with no arguments
    call(1,2,3);    # calls with a different set of arguments</pre>

<h1><a name="Parallel20dispatch">Parallel dispatch</a></h1>
<p>Any of the method call forms may be turned into a hyperoperator by
treating the method call as a postfix:</p>
<pre>
    @object».meth(@args)   # calls one method on each
    @object».?meth(@args)  # calls method if there is one on each
    @object».*meth(@args)  # calls all methods (0 or more) on each
    @object».+meth(@args)  # calls all methods (1 or more) on each
    @object».=meth(@args)  # calls mutator method on each
    @object»!meth(@args)   # calls private method on each</pre>
<p>Hyperoperators treat a junction as a scalar value, so saying:</p>
<pre>
    $junction».meth(@args);</pre>
<p>is just like:</p>
<pre>
    $junction.meth(@args);</pre>

<h1><a name="Multisubs20and20Multimethods">Multisubs and Multimethods</a></h1>
<p>The ``long name'' of a subroutine or method includes the type signature
of its invocant arguments.  The ``short name'' doesn't.  If you put
<code>multi</code> in front of any sub (or method) declaration, it allows
multiple long names to share a short name, provided all of them are
declared <code>multi</code>.  A sub (or method) without a <code>multi</code> doesn't share
with anything outside of it or declared prior to it.  Only one such
sub (or method) can inhabit a given namespace, and it hides any outer
subs (or less-derived methods) of the same short name.  It may share
with multis declared after it in the same scope if declared with the
keyword <code>proto</code>, but in that case it functions only as the final
tie-breaker if the inner multies can't decide among themselves what
to do.  (It may then, of course, decide to redispatch outside of the
current scope.)  The signature of such a proto-multi also nails down
the presumed order and naming of positional parameters, so that any
multi call with named arguments in that scope can presume to rearrange
those arguments into positional parameters based on that information.
(Unrecognized names remain named arguments.)</p>
<p>For subs or methods declared <code>multi</code>, only one instance of the long
name can be in any namespace, and it hides any outer (or less-derived)
routines with the same long name.  It does not hide any routines with
the same short name but a different long name.  In other words, multis
with the same short name can come from several different namespaces
provided their long names differ and their short names aren't hidden
by a non-multi declaration in some intermediate scope.</p>
<p>When you call a routine with a particular short name, if there are
multiple visible long names, they are all considered candidates.
They are sorted into an order according to how close the run-time types
of the arguments match up with the declared types of the parameters of
each candidate.  The best candidate is called, unless there's a tie,
in which case the tied candidates are redispatched using any additional
tiebreaker long names (see below).</p>
<p>If a tie still results, only candidates marked with the <code>default</code> trait are
considered, and the best matching default routine is used.  If there
are no default routines, or if the available defaults are also tied,
a final tie-breaking proto sub is called, if there is one (see above).
Otherwise an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>Ordinarily all the parameters of a multi sub are considered for dispatch.
Here's a declaration for an integer range operator with two parameters
in its long name:</p>
<pre>
    multi sub infix:&lt;..&gt;(Int $min, Int $max) {...}</pre>
<p>Sometimes you want to have parameters that aren't counted as part of the
long name.  For instance, if you want to allow an optional ``step'' parameter
to your range operator, but not consider it for multi dispatch, then put a
semicolon instead of a comma before it:</p>
<pre>
    multi sub infix:&lt;..&gt;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1) {...}</pre>
<p>The final semicolon, if any, determines the complete long name of a multi.
However, a given multi may advertise multiple long names, some
of which are shorter than the complete long name.  This is done by
putting a semicolon after each advertised long name (replacing the comma,
if present).  The initial dispatch starts by pretending that the shortest
advertised long name is the complete long name (and likewise across the entire
set of candidates).  Since the shorter long name does not guarantee uniqueness,
if that shorter long name is chosen for dispatch, and a tie would be
declared for that dispatch, the next longer set of long names may be
used to break ties, for those candidates that supply longer names.
(As a limiting case, putting a semicolon after every parameter produces
dispatch semantics like Common Lisp.)</p>
<p>Within a class, <code>multi submethod</code> is visible to both method-dispatch
and subroutine-dispatch.  A <code>multi method</code> never participates in the
subroutine-dispatch process.  It is dispatched just like a normal
method, then the tie-breaking rules of the previous paragraph are applied.
That is, the shortest long name of a multi method includes <em>only</em> the
single invocant, and any additional semicolons may only indicate long names
to be used as tiebreakers.</p>
<p>Conjecture: In order to specify dispatch that includes the return
type context, it is necessary to place a semicolon after the return type:</p>
<pre>
    multi infix:&lt;..&gt;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1 --&gt; Iterator;) {...}
    multi infix:&lt;..&gt;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1 --&gt; Selector;) {...}</pre>
<p>Note that such a declaration might have to delay dispatch until the
actual desired type is known!  (Generally, you might just consider
returning a flexible <code>Range</code> object instead of an anonymous partial
dispatch that may or may not be resolved at compile time via type
inferencing.  Therefore return-type tiebreaking need not be supported
in 6.0.0 unless some enterprising soul decides to make it work.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="Method20call20vs2e20Subroutine20call">Method call vs. Subroutine call</a></h2>
<p>The caller indicates whether to make a method call or subroutine call
by the call syntax.  The ``dot'' form and the indirect object form default to
method calls.  Calls with multiple arguments and operators with multiple
operands default to subroutine calls.</p>
<p>A function call with a single argument defaults to method calls:</p>
<pre>
    close($handle)
    close $handle</pre>
<p>Use a trailing comma if you want to make a subroutine call instead:</p>
<pre>
    close($handle,)</pre>
<p>This applies to prefix unary operators as well:</p>
<pre>
    !$obj;  # same as $obj.prefix:&lt;!&gt;</pre>
<p>A method call first considers methods (including multi-methods and submethods)
from the class hierarchy of <code>$handle</code>, and fails over to the subroutine
dispatcher as a last resort only if no method can be found in the class
hierarchy.</p>
<p>A subroutine call considers only visible subroutines (including submethods) of
that name.  There is no fail-over from subroutine to method dispatch.</p>

<h1><a name="Multi20dispatch">Multi dispatch</a></h1>
<p>Multi submethods work just like multi subs except they are constrained
to an exact type match on the invocant.</p>
<p>Perl 6.0.0 is not required to support multiple dispatch on named parameters,
only on positional parameters.  Note that most builtins will map known
named parameters to positional via a <code>proto</code> declaration.</p>
<p>Within a multiple dispatch, <code>next METHOD</code> means to try the next best
match, or next best default in case of tie, or the proto sub if there
is one.</p>
<p>Attributes are tied to a particular class definition, so a multi method
can only directly access the attributes of a class it's defined within
when the invocant is the ``self'' of that attribute.
However, it may call the private attribute accessors from a different
class if that other class has indicated that it trusts the class the
multi method is defined in:</p>
<pre>
    class MyClass {
        trusts Yourclass;
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>The syntax for calling back to <code>MyClass</code> is <code>$obj!MyClass::meth()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>sub</code> keyword is optional after either <code>multi</code> or <code>proto</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>proto</code> declaration must come before any matching multis, if at all.</p>

<p>Classes are primarily in charge of object management, and only
secondarily in charge of software reuse.  In Perl 6, roles take over
the job of managing software reuse.  Depending on how you care to look
at it, a role is like a partial class, or an interface with default
implementation, or a set of generic methods and their associated data,
or a class closed at compile time.</p>
<p>Roles may be composed into a class at compile time, in which case
you get automatic detection of conflicting methods.  A role may also
be mixed into a class or object at run time to produce an anonymous
derived class with extra capabilities, but in this case conflicting
methods are overridden by the new role silently.  In either case,
a class is necessary for instantiation--a role may not be directly
instantiated.</p>
<p>A role is declared like a class, but with a <code>role</code> keyword:</p>

<p>A role may not inherit from a class, but may be composed of other
roles.  However, this ``crony'' composition is not evaluated until
class composition time.  This means that if two roles bring in the
same crony, there's no conflict--it's just as if the class pulled in
the crony role itself and the respective roles didn't.  A role may
never conflict with itself regardless of its method of incorporation.
A role that brings in two conflicting crony roles *may* resolve them
as if it were a class.  This solution is accepted by the class unless
the class supplies its own solution.  If two different roles resolve
the same crony conflict two different ways, those roles are themselves
in conflict and must be resolved by a ``more derived'' role or the class.</p>
<p>A role doesn't know its own type until it is composed into a class.
Any mention of its main type (such as <code>::?CLASS</code>) is generic, as is
any reference to <code>self</code> or the type of the invocant.  You can use
a role name as a type, but only for constraints, not for declaring
actual objects.  (However, if you use a role as if it were a class,
an anonymous class is generated that composes the role, which provides
a way to force a role to test its crony composition for infelicities.)</p>
<p>A role's main type is generic by default, but you can also parameterize
other types explicitly using type parameters:</p>

<p>(Note that in this case you must not use ::Petfood in the inner declaration,

<p>If a role merely declares methods without defining them, it degenerates

<p>Note that, while these methods must become available at class
composition time, they might be supplied by any of: another role,
the class itself, or some superclass.  We know the methods that are
coming from the other roles or the class, but we don't necessarily know
the complete set of methods supplied by our super classes if they are
open or rely on wildcard delegation.  However, the class composer is
allowed to assume that only currently declared superclass methods or
non-wildcard methods are going to be available.  A stub can always
be installed somewhere to ``supply'' a missing method's declaration.</p>

    role Pet[::ID; $tag] {
        has ID $.collar .= new($tag);
    }</pre>
<p>Unlike in a class, within a role the <code>has</code> declarator distinguishes
private attribute declared with exclamation from those without.
To declare a private attribute that is shared by the class, use the
exclamationless notation in the declaration:</p>
<pre>
    has Nose $sniffer .= new();</pre>
<p>A completely private role attribute may be declared like this:</p>
<pre>
    has $!spleen;</pre>
<p>The name of such a private attribute is always considered lexically scoped.
If a role declares private lexical items, those items are private to
the role due to the nature of lexical scoping.  Accessors to such
items may be exported to the class, but this is not the default.
In particular, a role may say</p>
<pre>
    trusts ::?Class;</pre>
<p>to allow <code>self!attr()</code> access to the role's <code>$!attr</code> variables with the
class or from other roles composed into the class.  Conflicts between
private accessor are also caught at composition time, but of course
need not consider super classes, since no-one outside the current
class (or a trusted class) can call a private accessor at all.
(Private accessors are never virtual, and must be package qualified
if called from a trusted scope other than our own.  That is, it's
either <code>self!attr()</code> or <code>$obj!TrustsMe::attr().</code>)</p>
<p>Outside of the <code>has</code> declaration, the exclamation mark is again optional,
as with an ordinary private attribute in the class.</p>
<p>A role may also distinguish a shared method</p>
<pre>
    method foo ...</pre>
<p>from a nonshared private method:</p>
<pre>
    my method !foo ...</pre>
<p>Generally you'd just use a lexically scoped sub, though.</p>
<pre>
    my sub foo ...</pre>
<p>[Conjectural: To put a private sub into the class, say</p>
<pre>
    our sub !foo ...</pre>
<p>]</p>
<p>A role can abstract the decision to delegate:</p>
<pre>
    role Pet {
        has $groomer handles &lt;bathe groom trim&gt; = hire_groomer();
    }</pre>
<p>Note that this puts the three methods into the class as well as
<code>$groomer</code>.  In contrast, ``<code>has $!groomer</code>'' would only put the
three methods.</p>
<p>A role is allowed to declare an additional inheritance for its class when
that is considered an implementation detail:</p>
<pre>
    role Pet {
        is Friend;
    }</pre>
<p>A class incorporates a role with the verb ``does'', like this:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog is Mammal does Pet does Sentry {...}</pre>
<p>or equivalently, within the body of the class closure:</p>
<pre>
    class Dog {
        is Mammal;
        does Pet;
        does Sentry;
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>There is no ordering dependency among the roles.</p>
<p>A class's explicit method definition hides any role definition of
the same name.  A role method in turn hides any methods inherited
from other classes.</p>
<p>If there are no method name conflicts between roles (or with the
class), then each role's methods can be installed in the class.  If,
however, two roles try to introduce a method of the same name the
composition of the class fails.</p>
<p>There are several ways to solve method conflicts.  The first is simply to
write a class method that overrides the conflicting role methods, perhaps
figuring out which role method to call.</p>
<p>Alternately, if the role's methods are declared <code>multi</code>, they can be
disambiguated based on their long name.  If the roles forget to declare
them as multi, you can force a multi on the roles' methods by installing
a multi stub in the class being constructed:</p>
<pre>
    multi method shake {...}</pre>
<p>A proto method also works, and will be called if the multi fails:</p>
<pre>
    proto method shake { warn &quot;They couldn't decide&quot; }</pre>
<p>Conjectural: If the original invocant is in a variable that is
constrained to be of one role or another, then that type could be used
to dispatch to the correct role's method in cases where they can't
be distinguished by differences in the actual argument types:</p>
<pre>
    class DogTree {
        does DogBark;
        does TreeBark;
        multi method bark {...}
        ...
    }</pre>
<pre>
    my DogBark $dog = new DogTree;
    my TreeBark $tree = new DogTree;</pre>
<pre>
    $dog.bark();        # picks Dog role's bark method
    $tree.bark();       # picks Tree role's bark method</pre>
<p>Run-time mixins are done with <code>does</code> and <code>but</code>.  The <code>does</code> binary
operator is a mutator that derives a new anonymous class (if necessary)
and binds the object to it:</p>
<pre>
    $fido does Sentry</pre>
<p>The <code>does</code> operator returns the object so you can nest mixins:</p>
<pre>
    $fido does Sentry does Tricks does TailChasing does Scratch;</pre>
<p>Unlike the compile-time role composition, each of these layers on a new
mixin with a new level of inheritance, creating a new anonymous class
for dear old Fido, so that a <code>.chase</code> method from <code>TailChasing</code> hides a
<code>.chase</code> method from <code>Sentry</code>.</p>
<p>You can also mixin a precomposed set of roles:</p>
<pre>
    $fido does Sentry | Tricks | TailChasing | Scratch;</pre>
<p>This will level the playing field for collisions among the new set of roles,
and guarantees the creation of no more than one more anonymous class.</p>
<p>A role still can't conflict with itself, but it can hide its previous
methods in the parent class, and the calculation of what conflicts
is done again for the set of roles being mixed in.</p>
<p>A role applied with <code>does</code> may be parameterized with an initializer
in parentheses, but only if the role supplies exactly one attribute
to the mixin class:</p>
<pre>
    $fido does Wag($tail);
    $line does taint($istainted);</pre>
<p>The <code>but</code> operator creates a copy and works on that.  It also knows
how to generalize a particular enumerated value to its role.  So</p>

<p>Traits are just properties (roles) applied to declared items like
containers or classes.  It's the declaration of the item itself that
makes traits seem more permanent than ordinary properties.  In addition
to adding the property, a trait can also have side effects.</p>
<p>Traits are generally applied with the ``is'' keyword, though not always.
To define a trait handler for an ``is xxx'' trait, define one or
more multisubs into a property role like this:</p>
<pre>
    role xxx {
        has Int $.xxx;
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(xxx $trait, Class $container; $arg?) {...}
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(xxx $trait, Any $container; $arg?) {...}
    }</pre>
<p>Then it can function as a trait.  A well-behaved trait handler will say</p>
<pre>
    $container does xxx($arg);</pre>
<p>somewhere inside to set the metadata on the container correctly.
Since a class can function as a role when it comes to parameter type
matching, you can also say:</p>
<pre>
    class MyBase {
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(MyBase $base, Class $class; $arg?) {...}
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(MyBase $tied, Any $container; $arg?) {...}
    }</pre>
<p>These capture control if <code>MyBase</code> wants to capture control of how it gets
used by any class or container.  But usually you can just let it call
the generic defaults:</p>
<pre>
    multi *trait_auxiliary:is(Class $base, Class $class; $arg?) {...}</pre>
<p>which adds <code>$base</code> to the ``isa'' list of <code>$class</code>, or</p>
<pre>
    multi *trait_auxiliary:is(Class $tied, Any $container; $arg?) {...}</pre>
<p>which sets the ``tie'' type of the container to the implementation type
in <code>$tied</code>.</p>
<p>Most traits are introduced by use of a ``helping verb'', which could
be something like ``<code>is</code>'', or ``<code>will</code>'', or ``<code>can</code>'', or ``<code>might</code>'',
or ``<code>should</code>'', or ``<code>does</code>''.  We call these helping verbs ``trait
auxiliaries''. Here's ``<code>will</code>'', which (being syntactic sugar) merely
delegates to back to ``is'':</p>
<pre>
    multi sub *trait_auxiliary:will($trait, $container; &amp;arg) {
        trait_auxiliary:is($trait, $container, &amp;arg);
    }</pre>
<p>Other traits are applied with a single word, and we call one of those a
``trait verb''.  For instance, the ``<code>returns</code>'' trait
is defined something like this:</p>
<pre>
    role returns {
        has ReturnType $.returns;
        multi sub trait_verb:returns($container; ReturnType $arg) {
            $container does returns($arg);
        }
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>Unlike compile-time roles, which all flatten out in the same class,
compile-time traits are applied one at a time, like mixin roles.
You can, in fact, apply a trait to a container at run time, but
if you do, it's just an ordinary mixin role. You have to call the
appropriate <code>trait_auxiliary:is()</code> routine yourself if you want it to
do any extra shenanigans.  The compiler won't call it for you at run
time like it would at compile time.</p>

<p>Delegation lets you pretend that some other object's methods are your own.
Delegation is specified by a <code>handles</code> trait verb with an argument
specifying one or more method names that the current object and the

<pre>
    has $.fur is rw handles Groomable;</pre>
<p>then you get only those methods available via the <code>Groomable</code> role
or class.</p>
<p>Wildcard matches are evaluated only after it has been determined that
there's no exact match to the method name anywhere.  When you have
multiple wildcard delegations to different objects, it's possible
to have a conflict of method names.  Wildcard method matches are
evaluated in order, so the earliest one wins.  (Non-wildcard method
conflicts can be caught at class composition time.)</p>
<p>If, where you would ordinarily specify a string, you put a pair, then
the pair maps the method name in this class to the method name in the
other class.  If you put a hash, each key/value pair is treated as
such a mapping.  Such mappings are not considered wildcards.</p>
<pre>
    has $.fur handles { :shakefur&lt;shake&gt; :scratch&lt;get_fleas&gt; };</pre>
<p>You <em>can</em> do a wildcard renaming, but not with pairs.  Instead do smartmatch
with a substitution:</p>
<pre>
    has $.fur handles (s/^furget_/get_/);</pre>
<p>Ordinarily delegation is based on an attribute holding an object, but it can
also be based on the return value of a method:</p>
<pre>
    method select_tail handles &lt;wag hang&gt; {...}</pre>
<p>If your delegation object happens to be an array:</p>
<pre>
    has @handlers handles 'foo';</pre>
<p>then Perl 6 assumes that your array contains a list of potential
handlers, and you just want to call the <em>first</em> one that succeeds.
This is not considered a wildcard match unless the ``handles'' argument
forces it to be.</p>
<p>If your delegation object happens to be a hash:</p>
<pre>
    has %objects handles 'foo';</pre>
<p>then the hash provides a mapping from the string value of ``self''
to the object that should be delegated to:</p>
<pre>
    has %barkers handles &quot;bark&quot; =
                (Chihauhau =&gt; $yip,
                    Beagle =&gt; $yap,
                   Terrier =&gt; $arf,
                 StBernard =&gt; $woof,
                );
    method prefix:&lt;~&gt;( return &quot;$.breed&quot; )</pre>
<p>If the string is not found in the hash, a ``<code>next METHOD</code>'' is
automatically performed.</p>

<p>The type system of Perl consists of roles, classes, and subtypes.
You can declare a subtype like this:</p>
<pre>
    my subset Str_not2b of Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre>
    my Str subset Str_not2b where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>
<p>An anonymous subtype looks like this:</p>
<pre>
    Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>
<p>A <code>where</code> clause implies future smartmatching of some kind: the as-yet
unspecified object of the type on the left must match the selector on
the right.  Our example is roughly equivalent to this closure:</p>
<pre>
    { $_.does(Str) and $_ ~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/; }</pre>
<p>except that a subtype knows when to call itself.</p>
<p>A subtype is not a subclass.  Subclasses add capabilities, whereas
a subtype adds constraints (takes away capabilites).  A subtype is
primarily a handy way of sneaking smartmatching into multiple dispatch.
Just as a role allows you to specify something more general than a
class, a subtype allows you to specify something more specific than
a class.  A subtype specifies a subset of the values that the original
type specified, which is why we use the <code>subset</code> keyword for it.</p>
<p>While subtypes are primarily intended for restricting parameter types
for multiple dispatch, they also let you impose preconditions on
assignment.  If you declare any container with a subtype,
Perl will check the constraint against any value you might try to
bind or assign to the container.</p>
<pre>
    subset Str_not2b of Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;
    subset EvenNum   of Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 }</pre>
<pre>
    my Str_not2b $hamlet;
    $hamlet = 'isnt';   # Okay because 'isnt' ~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/
    $hamlet = 'amnt';   # Bzzzzzzzt!   'amnt' !~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/</pre>
<pre>
    my EvenNum $n;
    $n = 2;             # Okay
    $n = -2;            # Okay
    $n = 0;             # Okay
    $n = 3;             # Bzzzzzzzt</pre>
<p>It's legal to base one subtype on another; it just adds an additional
constraint.  That is, it's a subset of a subset.</p>
<p>You can use an anonymous subtype in a signature:</p>
<pre>
    sub check_even (Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 } $even) {...}</pre>
<p>That's a bit unwieldy, but by the normal type declaration rules you
can turn it around to get the variable out front:</p>
<pre>
    sub check_even ($even of Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 }) {...}</pre>
<p>and just for convenience we also let you write it:</p>
<pre>
    sub check_even (Num $even where { $^n % 2 == 0 }) {...}</pre>
<p>since all the type constraints in a signature parameter are just
anded together anyway.</p>
<p>Subtype constraints are used as tiebreakers in multiple dispatch:</p>
<pre>
    use Rules::Common :profanity;</pre>
<pre>
    multi sub mesg ($mesg of Str where /&lt;profanity&gt;/ is copy) {
        $mesg ~~ s:g/&lt;profanity&gt;/[expletive deleted]/;

    }</pre>

<p>An enum is a low-level class that can function as a role or property.
A given enum value can function as a subtype, a method, or as an ordinary
value (an argumentless sub).  The names of the values are specified as a list:</p>
<pre>
    my enum Day ['Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat'];
    my enum Day &lt;Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat&gt;;</pre>
<p>If the first value is unspecified, it defaults to 0.  To specify the
first value, use pair notation (see below).</p>
<p>If the declared type name begins with an uppercase letter, the default
type is <code>Int</code> or <code>Str</code>, depending on the type of the first value.
If the declared type is lowercase, the default return type is <code>int</code> or <code>buf</code>.</p>
<p>The type can be specified:</p>
<pre>
    my bit enum maybe &lt;no yes&gt;;
    my Int enum day ['Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat'];
    my enum day of uint4 &lt;Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat&gt;;</pre>
<p>An anonymous enum just makes sure each string turns into a pair with
sequentially increasing values, so:</p>
<pre>
    %e = enum &lt; ook! ook. ook? &gt;;</pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
    %e = ();
    %e&lt;ook!&gt; = 0;
    %e&lt;ook.&gt; = 1;
    %e&lt;ook?&gt; = 2;</pre>
<p>The enum installer inspects list values for pairs, where the value
of the pair sets the next value explicitly.  Non-pairs <code>++</code> the
previous value.  (Str and buf types increment like Perl 5 strings.)
Since the <code>«...»</code> quoter automatically recognizes
pair syntax along with interpolations, we can simply say:</p>
<pre>
    my enum DayOfWeek «:Sun(1) Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat»;</pre>
<pre>
    our Str enum Phonetic «:Alpha&lt;A&gt; Bravo Charlie Delta
                            Echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel India Juliet
                            Kilo Lima Mike November Oscar Papa
                            Quebec Romeo Sierra Tango Uniform
                            Victor Whiskey X-ray Yankee Zulu»;</pre>
<pre>
    enum roman [i =&gt; 1,   v =&gt; 5,
                x =&gt; 10,  l =&gt; 50,
                c =&gt; 100, d =&gt; 500,
                m =&gt; 1000];</pre>
<pre>
    my Item enum hex «:zero(0) one two three four five six seven eight nine
                      :ten&lt;a&gt; eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen»;</pre>
<p>You may import enum types; only non-colliding values are imported.
Colliding enum values are hidden and must be disambiguated with the
type name.  Any attempt to use the ambiguous name will result in a fatal
compilation error.  (All colliding values are hidden, not just the new one,
or the old one.)  Any explicit sub or type definition hides all imported
enum values of the same name but will produce a warning unless
<code>is redefined</code> is included.  Note that <code>true()</code> is a built-in function,
while True is short for <code>bool::True</code>.</p>
<p>Enum values may be used as a property on the right side
of a <code>but</code>, and the enum type will be intuited from the value to make
sure the object in question has the right semantics mixed in:</p>

<h1><a name="Open20vs20Closed20Classes">Open vs Closed Classes</a></h1>
<p>By default, all classes in Perl are non-final, which means you can derive
from them.  They are also open, which means you can add more methods
to them, though you have to be explicit that that is what you're doing:</p>
<pre>
    class Object is also {
        method wow () { say &quot;Wow, I'm an object.&quot; }
    }</pre>
<p>Otherwise you'll get a class redefinition error.  (Also, to completely
replace a definition, use ``<code>is instead</code>'' instead of ``<code>is also</code>''...but
don't do that.)</p>
<p>For optimization purposes, Perl 6 gives the top-level application the
right to close and finalize classes.</p>
<pre>
    use optimize :classes&lt;close finalize&gt;;</pre>
<p>This merely changes the application's default to closed and final,
which means that at the end of the main compilation (<code>CHECK</code> time)
the optimizer is allowed to look for candidate classes to close or
finalize.  But anyone (including the main application) can request
that any class stay open or basal, and the class closer/finalizer
must honor that.</p>
<pre>
    use class :open&lt;Mammal Insect&gt; :basal&lt;Str&gt;</pre>
<p>These properties may also be specified on the class definition:</p>
<pre>
    class Mammal is open {...}
    class Insect is open {...}
    class Str is basal {...}</pre>
<p>or by lexically scoped pragma around the class definition:</p>
<pre>
    {
        use class :open;
        class Mammal {...}
        class Insect {...}
    }
    {
        use class :basal;
        class Str {...}
    }</pre>
<p>There is <em>no</em> syntax for declaring individual classes closed or final.
The application may only request that the optimizer close and finalize
unmarked classes.</p>

</p>

<h1><a name="Interface20Consistency">Interface Consistency</a></h1>
<p>By default, all methods and submethods that do not declare an explicit
<code>*%</code> parameter will get an implicit <code>*%_</code> parameter declared for
them whether they like it or not.  In other words, all methods allow
unexpected named arguments, so that <code>next METHOD</code> semantics work
consistently.</p>
<p>If you mark a class ``<code>is hidden</code>'', it hides the current class
from ``<code>next METHOD</code>'' semantics, and incidentally suppresses the
autogeneration of <code>*%_</code> parameters.  Hidden classes may be visited
as <code>SUPER::</code>, but not via ``<code>next</code>''.</p>
<p>A similar effect can be achieved from the derived class by saying
<code>hides Base</code> instead of <code>is Base</code>.</p>
<p>
<a href="#__index__"><small>Back to Top</small></a>

<h1><a name="Introspection">Introspection</a></h1>
<p>Every class has a <code>META</code> function/method that lets you get at the
class's metaobject, which lets you get at all the metadata properties
for the class (or other metaobject protocol) implementing the objects
of the class:</p>
<pre>
    MyClass.getmethods()        # call MyClass's .getmethods method (error?)
    MyClass.META.getmethods()   # get the method list of MyClass</pre>
<p>The <code>^</code> metasyntax is equivalent to .META:</p>
<pre>
    MyClass.META.getmethods()   # get the method list of MyClass
    ^MyClass.getmethods()       # get the method list of MyClass
    MyClass.^getmethods()       # get the method list of MyClass</pre>
<p>Each object of the class also has a <code>.META</code> or <code>.^</code> method:</p>

    $obj.META.getmethods();
    $obj.^getmethods();</pre>

    $obj.META.does(Dog)
    $obj.META.isa(Mammal)</pre>
<p>But <code>Object</code> gives you shortcuts to those, if you don't override them.</p>
<p>The smartmatch:</p>
<pre>
    $obj ~~ Dog</pre>
<p>actually calls:</p>
<pre>
    $obj.META.does(Dog)</pre>
<p>which is true if <code>$obj</code> either ``does'' or ``isa'' <code>Dog</code> (or ``isa''
something that ``does'' <code>Dog</code>).</p>
<p>Unlike in Perl 5 where <code>.can</code> returns a single <code>Code</code> object,
Perl 6's version of <code>.META.can</code> returns a ``WALK'' iterator for a
set of routines that match the name, including all autoloaded and
wildcarded possibilities.  In particular, <code>.can</code> interrogates
any class package's <code>CANDO</code> method for names that are to be considered autoloadable methods
in the class, even if they haven't been declared yet.  Role composition
sometimes relies on this ability to determine whether a superclass supplies
a method of a particular name if it's required and hasn't been supplied
by the class or one of its roles.</p>
