<p>A class is a module declared with the <code>class</code> keyword. As with modules, the public storage, interface, and name of the class is represented by a package and its name, which is usually (but not necessarily) a global name.</p>

<p>Taken as an object, a class represents all of the possible values of its type, and the class object can thus be used as a proxy for any &#34;real&#34; object of that type in calculating what a generic object of that type can do. The class object is an Object, but it is not a Class, because there is no mandatory Class class in Perl 6. We wish to support both class-based and prototype-based OO programming. So all metaprogramming is done through the current object&#39;s <code>HOW</code> object, which can delegate metaprogramming to any metamodel it likes. However, by default, objects derived from Object support a fairly standard class-based model.</p>

<p>There are two basic class declaration syntaxes:</p>

<pre>    class Foo;          # rest of file is class definition
    ...

    class Bar {...}     # block is class definition</pre>

<p>The first form is allowed only as the first declaration in a compilation unit (that is, file or eval string).</p>

<p>In either case, the code represented by <code>...</code> executes at compile time as the body of a method of the metaclass, which is responsible for interpreting the keywords of the class definition. (And since a class is also a module, it also handles any module-oriented keywords. You can export subs from a class at &#34;use&#34; time, for instance.)</p>

<p>A named class declaration can occur as part of an expression, just like named subroutine declarations.</p>

<p>Classes are primarily for instance management, not code reuse. Consider using <code>roles</code> when you simply want to factor out common code.</p>

<p>Perl 6 supports multiple inheritance, anonymous classes, and autoboxing.</p>

<p>All public method calls are &#34;virtual&#34; in the C++ sense. More surprisingly, any class name mentioned in a method is also considered virtual, that is, polymorphic on the actual type of the object.</p>

<p>You may derive from any built-in type, but the derivation of a low-level type like <code>int</code> may only add behaviors, not change the representation. Use composition and/or delegation to change the representation.</p>

<p>Since there are no barewords in Perl 6, bare class names must be predeclared. You can predeclare a stub class and fill it in later just as you would a subroutine. Alternately, you can define a local class or type variable using the <code>::</code> type sigil. In an rvalue context the <code>::</code> prefix is a no-op, but in a declarational context, it binds a new type name within its declared scope.</p>

<p>Without a <code>my</code> or other scoping declarator, a bare <code>class</code> declarator declares an <code>our</code> declarator, that is, a name within the current package. Since class files begin parsing in the <code>*</code> (<code>GLOBAL</code>) package, the first class declaration in the file installs itself as a global name, and subsequent declarations then install themselves into the current class rather than the global package.</p>

<p>Hence, to declare an inner class in the current package (or module, or class), use <code>our class</code> or just <code>class</code>. To declare a lexically scoped class, use <code>my class</code>. Class names are always searched for from innermost scopes to outermost. As with an initial <code>::</code>, the presence of a <code>::</code> within the name does not imply globalness (unlike in Perl 5). So the outward search can look in children of the searched namespaces.</p>

<p>Class traits are set using <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre>    class MyStruct is rw {...}</pre>

<p>An &#34;isa&#34; is just a trait that happens to be another class:</p>

</div>


<pre>    class Dog is Mammal {...}</pre>

<p>MI is specified with multiple <code>is</code> modifiers:</p>

<pre>    class Dog is Mammal is Pet {...}</pre>

<p>Roles use <code>does</code> instead of <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre>    class Dog is Mammal does Pet {...}</pre>

<p>You may put these inside as well:</p>

<pre>    class Dog {
        is Mammal;
        does Pet;
        ...
    }</pre>

<p>Every object (including any class object) delegates to an instance of its metaclass. You can get at the metaclass of any object via the <code>HOW</code> method. A &#34;class&#34; object is just considered an &#34;empty&#34; instance in Perl 6, more properly called a &#34;prototype&#34; object. The actual class object is the metaclass object pointed to by the <code>HOW</code> syntax. So when you say &#34;Dog&#34;, you&#39;re referring to both a package and a prototype object, that latter of which points to the actual object representing the class via <code>HOW</code>. The prototype object differs from an instance object not by having a different type but rather in the extent to which it is defined. Some objects may tell you that they are defined, while others may tell you that they are undefined. That&#39;s up to the object, and depends on how the metaclass chooses to dispatch the .defined method.</p>

<p>The notation <code>^Dog</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>Dog.HOW</code>, so <code>^</code> can be considered the &#34;class&#34; sigil when you want to talk about the current metaclass instance.</p>

<p>Classes are open and non-final by default, but may easily be closed or finalized not by themselves but by the entire application, provided nobody issued an explicit compile-time request that the class stay open or non-final. (Or a site policy could close any applications that use the policy.) Platforms that do dynamic loading of sub-applications probably don&#39;t want to close or finalize classes wholesale, however.</p>

<p>Roles take on some of the compile-time function of closed classes, so you should probably use those instead anyway.</p>

<p>A private class can be declared using <code>my</code>; most privacy issues are handled with lexical scoping in Perl 6. The fact that importation is lexical by default also means that any names your class imports are also private by default.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Methods"
>Methods</a></h1>

<p>Methods are routines declared in a class with the <code>method</code> keyword:</p>

<pre>    method doit ($a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit ($self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit (MyName $self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }
    method doit (::?CLASS $self: $a, $b, $c) { ... }</pre>

<p>Declaration of the invocant is optional. You may always access the current invocant using the keyword <code>self</code>. You need not declare the invocant&#39;s type, since the lexical class of the invocant is known in any event because methods must be declared in the class of the invocant, though of course the actual (virtual) type may be a derived type of the lexical type. You could declare a more restrictive type, but that would probably be a bad thing for proper polymorphism. You may explicitly type the invocant with the lexical type, but any check for that will be optimized away. (The current lexically-determined class may always be named as <code>::?CLASS</code> even in anonymous classes or roles.)</p>

<p>Indirect object notation now requires a colon after the invocant if there are any arguments. If there are no arguments and you omit the colon, the notation is parsed either as a named unary operator or a list operator with one argument.</p>

<p>These two are considered method calls, which will fall back to a subroutine call if the method was not found:</p>

<pre>    $handle.close
    close $handle:</pre>

<p>To reject method call and only consider subs, simply omit the colon from the invocation line:</p>

<pre>    close($handle)
    close $handle</pre>

<p>However, here the built-in <b>IO</b> class defines <code>method close is export ()</code>, which puts a <code>multi sub close (IO)</code> in scope by default. Thus if the <code>$handle</code> evaluates to an IO object, then the two subroutine calls above are still translated into method calls.</p>

<p>Dot notation can omit the invocant if it&#39;s in <code>$_</code>:</p>

<pre>    .doit(1,2,3)</pre>

<p>It can use a simple scalar variable for the method name:</p>

<pre>    $obj.$methodname(1,2,3)</pre>

<p>The method name may also be quoted with either single or double quotes:</p>

<pre>    $obj.&#34;$methodname&#34;(1,2,3)   # same as previous
    $obj.&#39;$methodname&#39;(1,2,3)   # call method with $ in name!</pre>

<p>The latter is especially useful for postfix forms that might be confusing to the lexer or to the human reader:</p>

<pre>    $filename.&#39;-e&#39;      # same as -e $filename.
    .&#39;-e&#39;               # same as -e $_</pre>

<p>And in fact, if there is a choice between a unary prefix and a postfix operator, the indirect forms will choose the prefix operator. See S03. Likewise, presuming that <code>$op</code> does not name an ordinary method on <code>$left</code>, this calls any arbitrary infix operator:</p>

<pre>    $left.$op($right)</pre>

<p>Of course you can force that with:</p>

<pre>    $left.infix:{$op}($right)</pre>

<p>The <code>q</code> forms of quoting are not allowed for method indirection, since they&#39;d be taken as ordinary method names.</p>

<p>You must use a special syntax to call a private method:</p>

<pre>    $mybrain!think($pinky)</pre>

<p>Parentheses (or a colon) are required on the dot notation if there are any arguments (not counting adverbial arguments). There may be no space between the method name and the left parenthesis unless you use the dot form of parentheses:</p>

<pre>    .doit       # okay, no arguments
    .doit()     # okay, no arguments
    .doit ()    # ILLEGAL (two terms in a row)
    .doit.()    # okay, no arguments, same as .doit()
    .doit\ .()  # okay, no arguments, same as .doit() (long dot form)</pre>

<p>However, you can turn any of the legal forms above into a list operator by appending a colon:</p>

<pre>    .doit: 1,2,3        # okay, three arguments
    .doit(1): 2,3       # okay, one argument plus list
    .doit (): 1,2,3     # ILLEGAL (two terms in a row)
    .doit.(1): 2,3      # okay, same as .doit(1,2,3)
    .doit\ .(1,2): 3    # okay, same as .doit(1,2,3)</pre>

<p>In particular, this allows us to pass a closure in addition to the &#34;normal&#34; arguments:</p>

<pre>    .doit: { $^a &#60;=&#62; $^b }              # okay
    .doit(): { $^a &#60;=&#62; $^b }            # okay
    .doit(1,2,3): { $^a &#60;=&#62; $^b }       # okay</pre>

<p>In case of ambiguity between indirect object notation and dot form, the nearest thing wins:</p>

<pre>    dothis $obj.dothat: 1,2,3</pre>

<p>means</p>

<pre>    dothis ($obj.dothat(1,2,3))</pre>

<p>and you must say</p>

<pre>    dothis ($obj.dothat): 1,2,3</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>    $obj.dothat.dothis: 1,2,3</pre>

<p>if you mean the other thing.</p>

<p>Also note that if any term in a list is a bare closure or pointy sub, it will be considered to be the final argument of its list unless the closure&#39;s right curly is followed immediately by comma or comma surrogate. In particular, a method call does *not* extend the list, so you can say:</p>

<pre>    @list.grep: { $_ % 2 }.map: { $_ - 1 }.say</pre>

<p>and that will be taken as equivalent to</p>

<pre>    @list.grep({ $_ % 2 }).map({ $_ - 1 }).say</pre>

<p>Methods (and subs) may be declared as lvalues with <code>is rw</code>. You can use an argumentless <code>rw</code> method anywhere you can use a variable, including in <code>temp</code> and <code>let</code> statements. (In fact, you can use an <code>rw</code> method with arguments as a variable as long as the arguments are used only to identify the actual value to change, and don&#39;t otherwise have strange side effects that differ between rvalue and lvalue usage. Setter methods that expect the new value as an argument do not fall into the well-behaved category, however.)</p>

<p>Method calls on mutable scalars always go to the object contained in the scalar (autoboxing value types as necessary):</p>

<pre>    $result = $object.doit();
    $length = &#34;mystring&#34;.codes;</pre>

<p>Method calls on non-scalar variables just calls the <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code> or <code>Code</code> object bound to the variable:</p>

<pre>    $elems = @array.elems;
    @keys  = %hash.keys;
    $sig   = &#38;sub.signature;</pre>

<p>Use the <code>VAR</code> pseudo-function on a scalar variable to get at its underlying <code>Scalar</code> object:</p>

<pre>    if VAR($scalar).readonly {...}</pre>

<p>There&#39;s also a corresponding postfix:&#60;VAR&#62; macro that can be used as if it were a method:</p>

<pre>    if $scalar.VAR.readonly {...}</pre>

<p>(But since it&#39;s a macro, <code>VAR</code> is not dispatched as a real method. To dispatch to a real <code>.VAR</code> method use the indirect <code>$obj.&#34;VAR&#34;</code> form.)</p>

<p>You can also get at the container through the appropriate symbol table:</p>

<pre>    if MY::&#60;$scalar&#62;.readonly {...}</pre>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Class_methods"
>Class methods</a></h1>

<p>Other OO languages give you the ability to declare &#34;class&#34; methods that either don&#39;t need or actively prohibit calls on instances. Perl 6 gives you a choice. If you declare an ordinary method, it can function as a &#34;class&#34; method when you pass it a prototype object such as &#34;Dog&#34; regardless of how defined the prototype object is, as long as the method body doesn&#39;t try to access any information that is undefined in the current instance.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can associate a class method with the current metaclass instance, which as a singleton object knows your package, and can function as a more traditional &#34;class&#34; method:</p>

<pre>    our $count;
    method ^count { return $count }</pre>

<p>Such a <i>metaclass method</i> is always delegated to the <code>HOW</code> object just as methods like <code>.does</code> are, so it&#39;s possible to call this as <code>Dog.count</code> or <code>$dog.count</code>. However, best practice is probably to call such a class method as <code>Dog.^count</code> or <code>$dog.^count</code> to make it clear that it&#39;s in its own namespace separate from ordinary methods, and so that your class method cannot be accidentally overridden by an ordinary method in a subclass--presuming you don&#39;t want to allow for that possibility.</p>

<p>Submethods are for declaring infrastructural methods that shouldn&#39;t be inherited by subclasses, such as initializers:</p>

<pre>    submethod BUILD ($arg) {
        $.attr = $arg;
    }</pre>

<p>Apart from the keyword, submethod declaration and call syntax is identical to method syntax. You may mix methods and submethods of the same name within the class hierarchy, but only the methods are visible to derived classes via inheritance. A submethod is called only when a method call is dispatched directly to the current class.</p>

<p>[Conjecture: there is some relationship between &#34;submethod BUILD&#34; and &#34;method ^BUILD&#34; that possibly rises to the level of a unifiable identity...]</p>

<p>The &#34;true name&#34; of the private variable always has the exclamation, but much like with <code>our</code> variables, you may declare a lexically scoped alias to the private variable by saying:</p>

<pre>        has $brain;     # also declares $!brain;</pre>

<p>And any later references to the private variable within the same block may either use or omit the exclamation, as you wish to emphasize or ignore the privacy of the variable. Outside the block, you must use the <code>!</code> form. If you declare with the <code>!</code> form, you must use that form consistently everywhere. If you declare with the <code>.</code> form, you also get the private <code>!</code> form as a non-virtual name for the actual storage location, and you may use either <code>!</code> or <code>.</code> form anywhere within the class, even if the class is reopened. Outside the class you must use the public <code>.</code> form, or rely on a method call (which can be a private method call, but only for trusted classes).</p>

<p>For public attributes, some traits are copied to the accessor method. The <code>rw</code> trait causes the generated accessor to be declared <code>rw</code>, making it an lvalue method. The default is a read-only accessor.</p>

<p>You may write your own accessors to override any or all of the autogenerated ones.</p>

<p>The attribute variables may be used within instance methods to refer directly to the attribute values. Outside the instance methods, the only access to attributes is through the accessors since an object has to be specified. The dot form of attribute variables may be used in derived classes because the dot form always implies a virtual accessor call. Every <i>dot</i> declaration also declares a corresponding private <i>exclamation</i> storage location, and the exclamation form may be used only in the actual class, not in derived classes. Reference to the internal storage location via <code>$!foo</code> should generally be restricted to submethods. Ordinary methods should stick to the <code>$.foo</code> form.</p>

<p>Because <code>$.foo</code>, <code>@.foo</code>, <code>%.foo</code>, <code>&#38;.foo</code> are just shorthands of <code>self.foo</code> with different contexts, the class does not need to declare <code>has $.foo</code> as an attribute -- a <code>method foo</code> declaration can work just as well.</p>

<p>The dot form can take an argument list as well. These are all equivalent:</p>

<pre>    self.foo(1,2,3);    # a regular method call
    self.foo.(1,2,3);   # ditto
    $.foo(1,2,3);       # calls self.foo under $ context
    $.foo.(1,2,3);      # ditto
    @.foo(1,2,3);       # calls self.foo under @ context
    @.foo.(1,2,3);      # ditto</pre>

<p>Pseudo-assignment to an attribute declaration specifies the default value. The value on the right is evaluated at class composition time, that is, while the class is being compiled and the class object constructed. However, if the default value is a closure, that closure will be executed later at object initialization time. (Use a double closure to initialize to a closure value.) The topic of the closure will be the attribute being initialized, while &#34;self&#34; refers to the entire object being initialized.</p>

<p>All classes inherit a default <code>new</code> constructor from <code>Object</code>. It expects all arguments to be named parameters initializing attributes of the same name. You may write your own <code>new</code> to override the default, or write constructors with any other name you like. As in Perl 5, a constructor is any routine that calls <code>bless</code>. Unlike in Perl 5, you call it as a method on the class object (though any object may be used as a class object), passing the candidate as the first argument. To bless a hash as in Perl 5, say:</p>

<pre>    $object = $class.bless({k1 =&#62; $v1, k2 =&#62; $v2, ...});</pre>

<p>If the candidate is omitted, a candidate object is implicitly created in the current class by calling <code>CREATE</code>:</p>

<pre>    $object = $class.bless(k1 =&#62; $v1, k2 =&#62; $v2, ...)
    $object = $class.bless(:k1($v1), :k2($v2), ...)  # same</pre>

<p>(The default <code>CREATE</code> makes an opaque object.)</p>

<p>All arguments to this form of <code>bless</code> must be named arguments, not positional. Hence, the main purpose of custom constructors is to turn positional arguments into named arguments for <code>bless</code>. The <code>bless</code> method allows an object to be used for its class invocant. (Your constructor need not allow this). In any case, the object is not used as a prototype. Use <code>.clone</code> instead of <code>.bless</code> if that&#39;s what you mean.</p>

<p>Any named arguments to <code>bless</code> are automatically passed to the <code>CREATE</code> and <code>BUILD</code> routines. If you wish to pass special options to the <code>CREATE</code> routine (such as an alternate representation), call <code>CREATE</code> yourself and then pass the resulting candidate to <code>.bless</code>:</p>

<pre>    my $candidate = $class.CREATE(:repr&#60;P6opaque&#62;);
    $object = $class.bless($candidate, :k1($v1), :k2($v2))</pre>

<p>For the built-in default <code>CREATE</code> method, <code>P6opaque</code> is the default representation. Other possiblilities are <code>P6hash</code>, <code>P5hash</code>, <code>P5array</code>, <code>PyDict</code>, <code>Cstruct</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The <code>bless</code> function automatically calls all appropriate <code>BUILD</code> routines by calling the <code>BUILDALL</code> routine for the current class, which initializes the object in least-derived to most-derived order. <code>DESTROY</code> and <code>DESTROYALL</code> work the same way, only in reverse.</p>

<p>The default <code>BUILD</code> and <code>BUILDALL</code> are inherited from <code>Object</code>, so you need to write initialization routines only if you wish to modify the default behavior. If the name of a named argument begins with a <code>::</code> and corresponds to a class or role being built, the list value of that argument is passed as a list of named arguments to that class or role&#39;s <code>BUILD</code>. (If the value of that argument is a closure instead of a list, that closure will be called to return a list. The argument to that closure will be the name of the class currently being initialized.) In the absence of a class-labeled pair, all the arguments to <code>bless</code> are passed to the <code>BUILD</code>.</p>

<p>You can call an in-place mutator method like this:</p>

<pre>    @array .= sort;</pre>

<p>If there is a <code>self:sort</code> operator defined, that will be used. Otherwise one will be autogenerated from the ordinary <code>sort</code> operator, on the order of:</p>

<pre>    @array = @array.sort;</pre>

<p>One handy place for an in-place mutator is to call a constructor on a variable of a known type:</p>

<pre>    my Dog $spot .= new(:tail&#60;LONG&#62; :legs&#60;SHORT&#62;);</pre>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Calling_sets_of_methods"
>Calling sets of methods</a></h1>

<p>For any method name, there may be some number of candidate methods that could handle the request: typically, inherited methods or multi variants. The ordinary &#34;dot&#34; operator dispatches to a method in the standard fashion. There are also &#34;dot&#34; variants that call some number of methods with the same name:</p>

<pre>    $object.meth(@args)   # calls one method or dies
    $object.?meth(@args)  # calls method if there is one, otherwise undef
    $object.*meth(@args)  # calls all methods (0 or more)
    $object.+meth(@args)  # calls all methods (1 or more)</pre>

<p>The method name may be quoted when disambiguation is needed:</p>

<pre>    $object.&#34;+meth&#34;(@args)
    $object.&#39;VAR&#39;(@args)</pre>

<p>Any method can defer to the next candidate method in the list by saying <code>next METHOD</code>. Any method can stop the progression by saying <code>last METHOD</code>. The order and selection of the candidates may be specified by arguments to a pseudo-class known as <code>WALK</code>:</p>

<pre>    $object.*WALK[:breadth:omit($?CLASS)]::meth(@args);</pre>

<p>The <code>WALK</code> pseudo-class takes these arguments:</p>

<pre>    :canonical      # canonical dispatch order
    :ascendant      # most-derived first, like destruction order
    :descendant     # least-derived first, like construction order
    :preorder       # like Perl 5 dispatch
    :breadth        # like multi dispatch

    :super              # only immediate parent classes
    :method&#60;name&#62;       # only classes containing method declaration
    :omit(Selector)     # only classes that don&#39;t match selector
    :include(Selector)  # only classes that match selector</pre>

<p>In addition to <code>next METHOD</code>, the special function <code>call</code> dispatches to the next candidate, possibly with a new argument list:</p>

<pre>    call;           # calls with the original arguments
    call();         # calls with no arguments
    call(1,2,3);    # calls with a different set of arguments</pre>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Parallel_dispatch"
>Parallel dispatch</a></h1>

<p>Any of the method call forms may be turned into a hyperoperator by treating the method call as a postfix:</p>

<pre>    @object&#187;.meth(@args)   # calls one method on each
    @object&#187;.?meth(@args)  # calls method if there is one on each
    @object&#187;.*meth(@args)  # calls all methods (0 or more) on each
    @object&#187;.+meth(@args)  # calls all methods (1 or more) on each
    @object&#187;.=meth(@args)  # calls mutator method on each
    @object&#187;!meth(@args)   # calls private method on each</pre>

<p>Hyperoperators treat a junction as a scalar value, so saying:</p>

<pre>    $junction&#187;.meth(@args);</pre>

<p>is just like:</p>

<pre>    $junction.meth(@args);</pre>

<p>To hyperoperate over the values of a junction you have to explicitly pull out the values:</p>

<pre>    $junction.values&#187;.meth(@args);</pre>

<p>The &#34;long name&#34; of a subroutine or method includes the type signature of its invocant arguments. The &#34;short name&#34; doesn&#39;t. If you put <code>multi</code> in front of any sub (or method) declaration, it allows multiple long names to share a short name, provided all of them are declared <code>multi</code>. A sub (or method) without a <code>multi</code> doesn&#39;t share with anything outside of it or declared prior to it. Only one such sub (or method) can inhabit a given namespace, and it hides any outer subs (or less-derived methods) of the same short name. It may share with multis declared after it in the same scope if declared with the keyword <code>proto</code>, but in that case it functions only as the final tie-breaker if the inner multies can&#39;t decide among themselves what to do. (It may then, of course, decide to redispatch outside of the current scope.) The signature of such a proto-multi also nails down the presumed order and naming of positional parameters, so that any multi call with named arguments in that scope can presume to rearrange those arguments into positional parameters based on that information. (Unrecognized names remain named arguments.)</p>

<p>For subs or methods declared <code>multi</code>, only one instance of the long name can be in any namespace, and it hides any outer (or less-derived) routines with the same long name. It does not hide any routines with the same short name but a different long name. In other words, multis with the same short name can come from several different namespaces provided their long names differ and their short names aren&#39;t hidden by a non-multi declaration in some intermediate scope.</p>

<p>When you call a routine with a particular short name, if there are multiple visible long names, they are all considered candidates. They are sorted into an order according to how close the run-time types of the arguments match up with the declared types of the parameters of each candidate. The best candidate is called, unless there&#39;s a tie, in which case the tied candidates are redispatched using any additional tiebreaker long names (see below).</p>

<p>If a tie still results, only candidates marked with the <code>default</code> trait are considered, and the best matching default routine is used. If there are no default routines, or if the available defaults are also tied, a final tie-breaking proto sub is called, if there is one (see above). Otherwise an exception is thrown.</p>

<p>Ordinarily all the parameters of a multi sub are considered for dispatch. Here&#39;s a declaration for an integer range operator with two parameters in its long name:</p>

<pre>    multi sub infix:&#60;..&#62;(Int $min, Int $max) {...}</pre>

<p>Sometimes you want to have parameters that aren&#39;t counted as part of the long name. For instance, if you want to allow an optional &#34;step&#34; parameter to your range operator, but not consider it for multi dispatch, then put a semicolon instead of a comma before it:</p>

<pre>    multi sub infix:&#60;..&#62;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1) {...}</pre>

<p>The final semicolon, if any, determines the complete long name of a multi. However, a given multi may advertise multiple long names, some of which are shorter than the complete long name. This is done by putting a semicolon after each advertised long name (replacing the comma, if present). The initial dispatch starts by pretending that the shortest advertised long name is the complete long name (and likewise across the entire set of candidates). Since the shorter long name does not guarantee uniqueness, if that shorter long name is chosen for dispatch, and a tie would be declared for that dispatch, the next longer set of long names may be used to break ties, for those candidates that supply longer names. (As a limiting case, putting a semicolon after every parameter produces dispatch semantics like Common Lisp.)</p>

<p>Within a class, <code>multi submethod</code> is visible to both method-dispatch and subroutine-dispatch. A <code>multi method</code> never participates in the subroutine-dispatch process. It is dispatched just like a normal method, then the tie-breaking rules of the previous paragraph are applied. That is, the shortest long name of a multi method includes <i>only</i> the single invocant, and any additional semicolons may only indicate long names to be used as tiebreakers.</p>

<p>Conjecture: In order to specify dispatch that includes the return type context, it is necessary to place a semicolon after the return type:</p>

<pre>    multi infix:&#60;..&#62;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1 --&#62; Iterator;) {...}
    multi infix:&#60;..&#62;(Int $min, Int $max; Int $by = 1 --&#62; Selector;) {...}</pre>

<p>Note that such a declaration might have to delay dispatch until the actual desired type is known! (Generally, you might just consider returning a flexible <code>Range</code> object instead of an anonymous partial dispatch that may or may not be resolved at compile time via type inferencing. Therefore return-type tiebreaking need not be supported in 6.0.0 unless some enterprising soul decides to make it work.)</p>

name="Method_call_vs._Subroutine_call"
>Method call vs. Subroutine call</a></h2>

<p>The caller indicates whether to make a method call or subroutine call by the call syntax. The &#34;dot&#34; form and the indirect object form default to method calls. Calls with multiple arguments and operators with multiple operands default to subroutine calls.</p>

<p>A function call with a single argument defaults to method calls:</p>

<pre>    close($handle)
    close $handle</pre>

<p>Use a trailing comma if you want to make a subroutine call instead:</p>

<pre>    close($handle,)</pre>

<p>This applies to prefix unary operators as well:</p>

<pre>    !$obj;  # same as $obj.prefix:&#60;!&#62;</pre>

<p>A method call first considers methods (including multi-methods and submethods) from the class hierarchy of <code>$handle</code>, and fails over to the subroutine dispatcher as a last resort only if no method can be found in the class hierarchy.</p>

<p>A subroutine call considers only visible subroutines (including submethods) of that name. There is no fail-over from subroutine to method dispatch.</p>

<p>Multi submethods work just like multi subs except they are constrained to an exact type match on the invocant.</p>

<p>Perl 6.0.0 is not required to support multiple dispatch on named parameters, only on positional parameters. Note that most builtins will map known named parameters to positional via a <code>proto</code> declaration.</p>

<p>Within a multiple dispatch, <code>next METHOD</code> means to try the next best match, or next best default in case of tie, or the proto sub if there is one.</p>

<p>Attributes are tied to a particular class definition, so a multi method can only directly access the attributes of a class it&#39;s defined within when the invocant is the &#34;self&#34; of that attribute. However, it may call the private attribute accessors from a different class if that other class has indicated that it trusts the class the multi method is defined in:</p>

<pre>    class MyClass {
        trusts Yourclass;
        ...
    }</pre>

<p>The syntax for calling back to <code>MyClass</code> is <code>$obj!MyClass::meth()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>sub</code> keyword is optional after either <code>multi</code> or <code>proto</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>proto</code> declaration must come before any matching multis, if at all.</p>

<p>Classes are primarily in charge of object management, and only secondarily in charge of software reuse. In Perl 6, roles take over the job of managing software reuse. Depending on how you care to look at it, a role is like a partial class, or an interface with default implementation, or a set of generic methods and their associated data, or a class closed at compile time.</p>

<p>Roles may be composed into a class at compile time, in which case you get automatic detection of conflicting methods. A role may also be mixed into a class or object at run time to produce an anonymous derived class with extra capabilities, but in this case conflicting methods are overridden by the new role silently. In either case, a class is necessary for instantiation--a role may not be directly instantiated.</p>

<p>A role is declared like a class, but with a <code>role</code> keyword:</p>

<p>A role may not inherit from a class, but may be composed of other roles. However, this &#34;crony&#34; composition is not evaluated until class composition time. This means that if two roles bring in the same crony, there&#39;s no conflict--it&#39;s just as if the class pulled in the crony role itself and the respective roles didn&#39;t. A role may never conflict with itself regardless of its method of incorporation. A role that brings in two conflicting crony roles *may* resolve them as if it were a class. This solution is accepted by the class unless the class supplies its own solution. If two different roles resolve the same crony conflict two different ways, those roles are themselves in conflict and must be resolved by a &#34;more derived&#34; role or the class.</p>

<p>A role doesn&#39;t know its own type until it is composed into a class. Any mention of its main type (such as <code>::?CLASS</code>) is generic, as is any reference to <code>self</code> or the type of the invocant. You can use a role name as a type, but only for constraints, not for declaring actual objects. (However, if you use a role as if it were a class, an anonymous class is generated that composes the role, which provides a way to force a role to test its crony composition for infelicities.)</p>

<p>A role&#39;s main type is generic by default, but you can also parameterize other types explicitly using type parameters:</p>

<p>(Note that in this case you must not use ::Petfood in the inner declaration, or it would rebind the type to type of the actual food parameter.)</p>

<pre>    role Pet {
        method feed ($food) {...}
        method groom () {...}
        method scratch (:$where) {...}
    }</pre>

<p>Note that, while these methods must become available at class composition time, they might be supplied by any of: another role, the class itself, or some superclass. We know the methods that are coming from the other roles or the class, but we don&#39;t necessarily know the complete set of methods supplied by our super classes if they are open or rely on wildcard delegation. However, the class composer is allowed to assume that only currently declared superclass methods or non-wildcard methods are going to be available. A stub can always be installed somewhere to &#34;supply&#34; a missing method&#39;s declaration.</p>

<p>Unlike in a class, within a role the <code>has</code> declarator distinguishes private attribute declared with exclamation from those without. To declare a private attribute that is shared by the class, use the exclamationless notation in the declaration:</p>

<pre>    has Nose $sniffer .= new();</pre>

<p>A completely private role attribute may be declared like this:</p>

<pre>    has $!spleen;</pre>

<p>The name of such a private attribute is always considered lexically scoped. If a role declares private lexical items, those items are private to the role due to the nature of lexical scoping. Accessors to such items may be exported to the class, but this is not the default. In particular, a role may say</p>

<pre>    trusts ::?Class;</pre>

<p>to allow <code>self!attr()</code> access to the role&#39;s <code>$!attr</code> variables with the class or from other roles composed into the class. Conflicts between private accessor are also caught at composition time, but of course need not consider super classes, since no-one outside the current class (or a trusted class) can call a private accessor at all. (Private accessors are never virtual, and must be package qualified if called from a trusted scope other than our own. That is, it&#39;s either <code>self!attr()</code> or <code>$obj!TrustsMe::attr().</code>)</p>

<p>Outside of the <code>has</code> declaration, the exclamation mark is again optional, as with an ordinary private attribute in the class.</p>

<p>A role may also distinguish a shared method</p>

<pre>    method foo ...</pre>

<p>from a nonshared private method:</p>

<pre>    my method !foo ...</pre>

<p>Generally you&#39;d just use a lexically scoped sub, though.</p>

<pre>    my sub foo ...</pre>

<p>[Conjectural: To put a private sub into the class, say</p>

<pre>    our sub !foo ...</pre>

<p>]</p>

<p>A role can abstract the decision to delegate:</p>

<pre>    role Pet {
        has $groomer handles &#60;bathe groom trim&#62; = hire_groomer();
    }</pre>

<p>Note that this puts the three methods into the class as well as <code>$groomer</code>. In contrast, &#34;<code>has $!groomer</code>&#34; would only put the three methods.</p>

<p>A role is allowed to declare an additional inheritance for its class when that is considered an implementation detail:</p>

<pre>    role Pet {
        is Friend;
    }</pre>

<p>A class incorporates a role with the verb &#34;does&#34;, like this:</p>

<pre>    class Dog is Mammal does Pet does Sentry {...}</pre>

<p>or equivalently, within the body of the class closure:</p>

<pre>    class Dog {
        is Mammal;
        does Pet;
        does Sentry;
        ...
    }</pre>

<p>There is no ordering dependency among the roles.</p>

<p>A class&#39;s explicit method definition hides any role definition of the same name. A role method in turn hides any methods inherited from other classes.</p>

<p>If there are no method name conflicts between roles (or with the class), then each role&#39;s methods can be installed in the class. If, however, two roles try to introduce a method of the same name the composition of the class fails.</p>

<p>There are several ways to solve method conflicts. The first is simply to write a class method that overrides the conflicting role methods, perhaps figuring out which role method to call.</p>

<p>Alternately, if the role&#39;s methods are declared <code>multi</code>, they can be disambiguated based on their long name. If the roles forget to declare them as multi, you can force a multi on the roles&#39; methods by installing a multi stub in the class being constructed:</p>

<pre>    multi method shake {...}</pre>

<p>A proto method also works, and will be called if the multi fails:</p>

<pre>    proto method shake { warn &#34;They couldn&#39;t decide&#34; }</pre>

<p>Conjectural: If the original invocant is in a variable that is constrained to be of one role or another, then that type could be used to dispatch to the correct role&#39;s method in cases where they can&#39;t be distinguished by differences in the actual argument types:</p>

<pre>    class DogTree {
        does DogBark;
        does TreeBark;
        multi method bark {...}
        ...
    }

    my DogBark $dog = new DogTree;
    my TreeBark $tree = new DogTree;

    $dog.bark();        # picks Dog role&#39;s bark method
    $tree.bark();       # picks Tree role&#39;s bark method</pre>

<p>Run-time mixins are done with <code>does</code> and <code>but</code>. The <code>does</code> binary operator is a mutator that derives a new anonymous class (if necessary) and binds the object to it:</p>

<pre>    $fido does Sentry</pre>

<p>The <code>does</code> operator returns the object so you can nest mixins:</p>

<pre>    $fido does Sentry does Tricks does TailChasing does Scratch;</pre>

<p>Unlike the compile-time role composition, each of these layers on a new mixin with a new level of inheritance, creating a new anonymous class for dear old Fido, so that a <code>.chase</code> method from <code>TailChasing</code> hides a <code>.chase</code> method from <code>Sentry</code>.</p>

<p>You can also mixin a precomposed set of roles:</p>

<pre>    $fido does Sentry | Tricks | TailChasing | Scratch;</pre>

<p>This will level the playing field for collisions among the new set of roles, and guarantees the creation of no more than one more anonymous class.</p>

<p>A role still can&#39;t conflict with itself, but it can hide its previous methods in the parent class, and the calculation of what conflicts is done again for the set of roles being mixed in.</p>

<p>A role applied with <code>does</code> may be parameterized with an initializer in parentheses, but only if the role supplies exactly one attribute to the mixin class:</p>

<pre>    $fido does Wag($tail);
    $line does taint($istainted);</pre>

<p>The <code>but</code> operator creates a copy and works on that. It also knows how to generalize a particular enumerated value to its role. So</p>

<p>Traits are just properties (roles) applied to declared items like containers or classes. It&#39;s the declaration of the item itself that makes traits seem more permanent than ordinary properties. In addition to adding the property, a trait can also have side effects.</p>

<p>Traits are generally applied with the &#34;is&#34; keyword, though not always. To define a trait handler for an &#34;is xxx&#34; trait, define one or more multisubs into a property role like this:</p>

<pre>    role xxx {
        has Int $.xxx;
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(xxx $trait, Class $container; $arg?) {...}
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(xxx $trait, Any $container; $arg?) {...}
    }</pre>

<p>Then it can function as a trait. A well-behaved trait handler will say</p>

<pre>    $container does xxx($arg);</pre>

<p>somewhere inside to set the metadata on the container correctly. Since a class can function as a role when it comes to parameter type matching, you can also say:</p>

<pre>    class MyBase {
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(MyBase $base, Class $class; $arg?) {...}
        multi trait_auxiliary:is(MyBase $tied, Any $container; $arg?) {...}
    }</pre>

<p>These capture control if <code>MyBase</code> wants to capture control of how it gets used by any class or container. But usually you can just let it call the generic defaults:</p>

<pre>    multi *trait_auxiliary:is(Class $base, Class $class; $arg?) {...}</pre>

<p>which adds <code>$base</code> to the &#34;isa&#34; list of <code>$class</code>, or</p>

<pre>    multi *trait_auxiliary:is(Class $tied, Any $container; $arg?) {...}</pre>

<p>which sets the &#34;tie&#34; type of the container to the implementation type in <code>$tied</code>.</p>

<p>Most traits are introduced by use of a &#34;helping verb&#34;, which could be something like &#34;<code>is</code>&#34;, or &#34;<code>will</code>&#34;, or &#34;<code>can</code>&#34;, or &#34;<code>might</code>&#34;, or &#34;<code>should</code>&#34;, or &#34;<code>does</code>&#34;. We call these helping verbs &#34;trait auxiliaries&#34;. Here&#39;s &#34;<code>will</code>&#34;, which (being syntactic sugar) merely delegates to back to &#34;is&#34;:</p>

<pre>    multi sub *trait_auxiliary:will($trait, $container; &#38;arg) {
        trait_auxiliary:is($trait, $container, &#38;arg);
    }</pre>

<p>Other traits are applied with a single word, and we call one of those a &#34;trait verb&#34;. For instance, the &#34;<code>returns</code>&#34; trait is defined something like this:</p>

<pre>    role returns {
        has ReturnType $.returns;
        multi sub trait_verb:returns($container; ReturnType $arg) {
            $container does returns($arg);
        }
        ...
    }</pre>

<p>Unlike compile-time roles, which all flatten out in the same class, compile-time traits are applied one at a time, like mixin roles. You can, in fact, apply a trait to a container at run time, but if you do, it&#39;s just an ordinary mixin role. You have to call the appropriate <code>trait_auxiliary:is()</code> routine yourself if you want it to do any extra shenanigans. The compiler won&#39;t call it for you at run time like it would at compile time.</p>

<p>Wildcard matches are evaluated only after it has been determined that there&#39;s no exact match to the method name anywhere.

<p>then Perl 6 assumes that your array contains a list of potential handlers, and you just want to call the <i>first</i> one that succeeds. This is not considered a wildcard match unless the &#34;handles&#34; argument forces it to be.</p>

<p>If your delegation object happens to be a hash:</p>

<pre>    has %objects handles &#39;foo&#39;;</pre>

<p>then the hash provides a mapping from the string value of &#34;self&#34; to the object that should be delegated to:</p>

<pre>    has %barkers handles &#34;bark&#34; =
                (Chihauhau =&#62; $yip,
                    Beagle =&#62; $yap,
                   Terrier =&#62; $arf,
                 StBernard =&#62; $woof,
                );
    method prefix:&#60;~&#62;( return &#34;$.breed&#34; )</pre>

<p>If the string is not found in the hash, a &#34;<code>next METHOD</code>&#34; is automatically performed.</p>

<p>The type system of Perl consists of roles, classes, and subtypes. You can declare a subtype like this:</p>

<pre>    my subset Str_not2b of Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre>    my Str subset Str_not2b where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>

<p>An anonymous subtype looks like this:</p>

<pre>    Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;</pre>

<p>A <code>where</code> clause implies future smartmatching of some kind: the as-yet unspecified object of the type on the left must match the selector on the right. Our example is roughly equivalent to this closure:</p>

<pre>    { $_.does(Str) and $_ ~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/; }</pre>

<p>except that a subtype knows when to call itself.</p>

<p>A subtype is not a subclass. Subclasses add capabilities, whereas a subtype adds constraints (takes away capabilites). A subtype is primarily a handy way of sneaking smartmatching into multiple dispatch. Just as a role allows you to specify something more general than a class, a subtype allows you to specify something more specific than a class. A subtype specifies a subset of the values that the original type specified, which is why we use the <code>subset</code> keyword for it.</p>

<p>While subtypes are primarily intended for restricting parameter types for multiple dispatch, they also let you impose preconditions on assignment. If you declare any container with a subtype, Perl will check the constraint against any value you might try to bind or assign to the container.</p>

<pre>    subset Str_not2b of Str where /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/;
    subset EvenNum   of Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 }

    my Str_not2b $hamlet;
    $hamlet = &#39;isnt&#39;;   # Okay because &#39;isnt&#39; ~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/
    $hamlet = &#39;amnt&#39;;   # Bzzzzzzzt!   &#39;amnt&#39; !~~ /^[isnt|arent|amnot|aint]$/

    my EvenNum $n;
    $n = 2;             # Okay
    $n = -2;            # Okay
    $n = 0;             # Okay
    $n = 3;             # Bzzzzzzzt</pre>

<p>It&#39;s legal to base one subtype on another; it just adds an additional constraint. That is, it&#39;s a subset of a subset.</p>

<p>You can use an anonymous subtype in a signature:</p>

<pre>    sub check_even (Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 } $even) {...}</pre>

<p>That&#39;s a bit unwieldy, but by the normal type declaration rules you can turn it around to get the variable out front:</p>

<pre>    sub check_even ($even of Num where { $^n % 2 == 0 }) {...}</pre>

<p>and just for convenience we also let you write it:</p>

<pre>    sub check_even (Num $even where { $^n % 2 == 0 }) {...}</pre>

<p>since all the type constraints in a signature parameter are just anded together anyway.</p>

<p>Subtype constraints are used as tiebreakers in multiple dispatch:</p>

<pre>    use Rules::Common :profanity;

    multi sub mesg ($mesg of Str where /&#60;profanity&#62;/ is copy) {
        $mesg ~~ s:g/&#60;profanity&#62;/[expletive deleted]/;
        print $MESG_LOG: $mesg;
    }

    multi sub mesg ($mesg of Str) {
        print $MESG_LOG: $mesg;
    }</pre>

<p>For multi dispatch, a long name with a matching constraint is preferred over an equivalent one with no constraint. So the first <code>mesg</code> above is preferred if the constraint matches, and otherwise the second is preferred.</p>

<p>An enum is a low-level class that can function as a role or property. A given enum value can function as a subtype, a method, or as an ordinary value (an argumentless sub). The names of the values are specified as a list:</p>

<pre>    my enum Day [&#39;Sun&#39;,&#39;Mon&#39;,&#39;Tue&#39;,&#39;Wed&#39;,&#39;Thu&#39;,&#39;Fri&#39;,&#39;Sat&#39;];
    my enum Day &#60;Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat&#62;;</pre>

<p>If the first value is unspecified, it defaults to 0. To specify the first value, use pair notation (see below).</p>

<p>If the declared type name begins with an uppercase letter, the default type is <code>Int</code> or <code>Str</code>, depending on the type of the first value. If the declared type is lowercase, the default return type is <code>int</code> or <code>buf</code>.</p>

<p>The type can be specified:</p>

<pre>    my bit enum maybe &#60;no yes&#62;;
    my Int enum day [&#39;Sun&#39;,&#39;Mon&#39;,&#39;Tue&#39;,&#39;Wed&#39;,&#39;Thu&#39;,&#39;Fri&#39;,&#39;Sat&#39;];
    my enum day of uint4 &#60;Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat&#62;;</pre>

<p>An anonymous enum just makes sure each string turns into a pair with sequentially increasing values, so:</p>

<pre>    %e = enum &#60; ook! ook. ook? &#62;;</pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre>    %e = ();
    %e&#60;ook!&#62; = 0;
    %e&#60;ook.&#62; = 1;
    %e&#60;ook?&#62; = 2;</pre>

<p>The enum installer inspects list values for pairs, where the value of the pair sets the next value explicitly. Non-pairs <code>++</code> the previous value. (Str and buf types increment like Perl 5 strings.) Since the <code>&#171;...&#187;</code> quoter automatically recognizes pair syntax along with interpolations, we can simply say:</p>

<pre>    my enum DayOfWeek &#171;:Sun(1) Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat&#187;;

    our Str enum Phonetic &#171;:Alpha&#60;A&#62; Bravo Charlie Delta
                            Echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel India Juliet

                            Victor Whiskey X-ray Yankee Zulu&#187;;

    enum roman [i =&#62; 1,   v =&#62; 5,
                x =&#62; 10,  l =&#62; 50,
                c =&#62; 100, d =&#62; 500,
                m =&#62; 1000];

                      :ten&#60;a&#62; eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen&#187;;</pre>

<p>You may import enum types; only non-colliding values are imported. Colliding enum values are hidden and must be disambiguated with the type name. Any attempt to use the ambiguous name will result in a fatal compilation error. (All colliding values are hidden, not just the new one, or the old one.) Any explicit sub or type definition hides all imported enum values of the same name but will produce a warning unless <code>is redefined</code> is included. Note that true() is a built-in function, while True is short for <code>bool::True</code>.</p>

<p>Enum values may be used as a property on the right side of a <code>but</code>, and the enum type will be intuited from the value to make sure the object in question has the right semantics mixed in:</p>

<p>For optimization purposes, Perl 6 gives the top-level application the right to close and finalize classes.</p>

<pre>    use optimize :classes&#60;close finalize&#62;;</pre>

<p>This merely changes the application&#39;s default to closed and final, which means that at the end of the main compilation (<code>CHECK</code> time) the optimizer is allowed to look for candidate classes to close or finalize. But anyone (including the main application) can request that any class stay open or basal, and the class closer/finalizer must honor that.</p>

<pre>    use class :open&#60;Mammal Insect&#62; :basal&#60;Str&#62;</pre>

<p>These properties may also be specified on the class definition:</p>

<pre>    class Mammal is open {...}
    class Insect is open {...}
    class Str is basal {...}</pre>

<p>or by lexically scoped pragma around the class definition:</p>

<pre>    {
        use class :open;
        class Mammal {...}
        class Insect {...}
    }
    {
        use class :basal;
        class Str {...}
    }</pre>

<p>There is <i>no</i> syntax for declaring individual classes closed or final. The application may only request that the optimizer close and finalize unmarked classes.</p>

<p>By default, all methods and submethods that do not declare an explicit <code>*%</code> parameter will get an implicit <code>*%_</code> parameter declared for them whether they like it or not. In other words, all methods allow unexpected named arguments, so that <code>next METHOD</code> semantics work consistently.</p>

<p>If you mark a class &#34;<code>is hidden</code>&#34;, it hides the current class from &#34;<code>next METHOD</code>&#34; semantics, and incidentally suppresses the autogeneration of <code>*%_</code> parameters. Hidden classes may be visited as <code>SUPER::</code>, but not via &#34;<code>next</code>&#34;.</p>

<p>A similar effect can be achieved from the derived class by saying <code>hides Base</code> instead of <code>is Base</code>.</p>

<p>None of these methods takes arguments, so they may also be used as named unary operators:</p>

<pre>    $obj.WHAT   # method form of P5&#39;s ref
    WHAT $obj   # unary form of P5&#39;s ref</pre>

<p>These are all actually macros, not true operators or methods. If you get a foreign object from another language and need to call its <code>.WHERE</code> method, you can say:</p>

<pre>    $obj.&#34;WHERE&#34;</pre>

<p>And if you don&#39;t know the method name in advance, you&#39;d be using the variable form anyway:</p>

<pre>    $obj.$somemeth</pre>

<p>which also bypasses the macros.</p>

<p>For now Perl 6 reserves the right to change how all these macros and the corresponding <code>^</code> forms are defined in terms of each other.</p>

<p>In general, use of these in ordinary code should be a red flag that Something Very Strange is going on. (Hence the allcaps.) Most code should use Perl 6&#39;s operators that make use of this information implicitly. For instance, instead of</p>

<pre>    $obj.WHAT eq &#39;Dog&#39;
    $x.WHICH === $y.WHICH
    $obj.WHAT.bless(%args)</pre>

<p>you usually just want:</p>

<pre>    $obj ~~ Dog
    $x === $y
    $obj.bless(%args)</pre>

<p>Every class has a <code>HOW</code> function/method that lets you get at the class&#39;s metaobject, which lets you get at all the metadata properties for the class (or other metaobject protocol) implementing the objects of the class:</p>

<pre>    MyClass.methods()           # call MyClass&#39;s .methods method (error?)
    MyClass.HOW.methods()       # get the method list of MyClass</pre>

<p>The <code>^</code> metasyntax is equivalent to <code>.HOW</code>:</p>

<pre>    MyClass.HOW.methods()       # get the method list of MyClass
    ^MyClass.methods()  # get the method list of MyClass
    MyClass.^methods()  # get the method list of MyClass</pre>

<p>Each object of the class also has a <code>.HOW</code> or <code>.^</code> method:</p>

    $obj.^methods();</pre>

<p>These are for the standard Perl 6 Meta-Object Protocol, but other MOPs may define other traits. The identifier should probably be accessed through the <code>.WHO</code> object in any case, which may have its own object methods depending on how type namespaces evolve over time. Which of these items are actually part of the <code>.HOW</code> object and which are delegated back to the package and prototype objects is up to the MOP. (Note also that anonymous classes may have anonymous packages and prototype objects, in which case stringification is not likely to produce something of interest to non-gurus.)</p>

<p>The <code>.HOW.methods</code> method returns method-descriptors containing:</p>

<pre>    name                the name of the method
    signature           the parameters of the method
    returns             the return type of the method
    multi               whether duplicate names are allowed
    do                  the method body</pre>

<p>The <code>.methods</code> method has a selector parameter that lets you specify whether you want to see a flattened or hierarchical view, whether you&#39;re interested in private methods, and so forth.</p>

<p>The <code>.attributes</code> method returns a list of attribute descriptors that have traits like these:</p>

<pre>    name
    type
    scope
    rw
    private
    accessor
    build
    readonly</pre>

<p>Strictly speaking, metamethods like <code>.isa()</code>, <code>.does()</code>, and <code>.can()</code> should be called through the meta object:</p>

<p>These, may, of course, be overridden in a subclass, so don&#39;t use the short form unless you wish to allow for overrides. In general, <code>Any</code> will delegate only those metamethods that read well when reasoning about an individual object. Infrastructural methods like <code>.methods</code> and <code>.attributes</code> are not delegated, so <code>$obj.methods</code> fails.</p>

<p>The smartmatch:</p>

<pre>    $obj ~~ Dog</pre>

<p>actually calls:</p>

<pre>    $obj.HOW.does(Dog)</pre>

<p>which is true if <code>$obj</code> either &#34;does&#34; or &#34;isa&#34; <code>Dog</code> (or &#34;isa&#34; something that &#34;does&#34; <code>Dog</code>).</p>

<p>Unlike in Perl 5 where <code>.can</code> returns a single <code>Code</code> object, Perl 6&#39;s version of <code>.HOW.can</code> returns a &#34;WALK&#34; iterator for a set of routines that match the name, including all autoloaded and wildcarded possibilities. In particular, <code>.can</code> interrogates any class package&#39;s <code>CANDO</code> method for names that are to be considered autoloadable methods in the class, even if they haven&#39;t been declared yet. Role composition sometimes relies on this ability to determine whether a superclass supplies a method of a particular name if it&#39;s required and hasn&#39;t been supplied by the class or one of its roles.</p>
