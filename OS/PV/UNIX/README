This is a UNIX C implemenation for bigplate.pl in the parent directory.

To build this application, you need to enter the following commands under a UNIX shell:

	chmod +x clean build run
	./build
	./clean

To get the application running, you can simply enter the command

	./run

and then you can check the four processes output later:

	cat f.out
	cat m.out
	cat s.out
	cat d.out

It's worth mentioning that the clean may not work in OSes other than Solaris, although
it's written in Perl. Its portibility still needs love.

When you modify the keys for semaphores or shared memories, you have to update the
keys in clean.cfg accordingly.
