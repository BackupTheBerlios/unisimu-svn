This is a UNIX C implemenation for bigplate.pl in the parent directory.

To build this application, you need to enter the following commands under a UNIX shell:

	chmod +x clean build run
	./build
	./clean

To get the application running, you can simply enter the command

	./run

and then you can check the four processes output later:

	cat f.out
	cat m.out
	cat s.out
	cat d.out

It's a good habit to clean up the shared resources when you has your job done. Simply
put the following commands to do the cleaning:

	./clean

It's worth mentioning that the clean may not work in OSes other than Solaris, although
it's written in Perl. Its portibility still needs love.

When you modify the keys for semaphores or shared memories, you have to update the
keys in clean.cfg accordingly.

When you obtain the following error message from the ``init'' program:

	Failed to create semaphore 'can_put'.

then you should change the value for the SEED constant in ``app.h'' to another arbitrary
value. Because someone else must has created a semaphore of the same key for
himself/herself in the same environment. Remember to update the ``clean.cfg'' file
accordingly. If this method still doesn't help, try to remove clean.cfg temporarily,
and run the following command again:

	./clean
