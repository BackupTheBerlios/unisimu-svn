This is a multi-backend compiler for the Kid programming
language designed by Agent Zhang. The main goal of Kid 
is to demonstrate compiler construction and structrual
program correctness proving techniques.

The parser for Kid (Kid::Parser) is mostly done, and the
Perl backend (Kid::Perl) is implemented and tested.
