DESCRIPTION

This is a multi-backend compiler for the Kid programming
language designed by Agent Zhang. The main goal of Kid 
is to demonstrate compiler construction and structrual
program correctness proving techniques.

STATUS

The parser for Kid (Kid::Parser) is mostly done, and the
Perl backend (Kid::Perl), XML backend (Kid::XML),
Maple backend (Kid::Maple), Logical expression backend
(Kid::Logic and Kid::Logic::Disjoint), mathematical
model backend (Kid::MathModel), and mathematical
model solver (Kid::MathModel::Eval) are both implemented
and tested.
