DESCRIPTION

This is a multi-backend compiler for the Kid programming
language designed by Agent Zhang. The main goal of Kid 
is to demonstrate compiler construction and structrual
program correctness proving techniques.

STATUS

The parser for Kid (Kid::Parser) is mostly done, and the
Perl backend (Kid::Perl), XML backend (Kid::XML),
Maple backend (Kid::Maple), Logical expression backend
(Kid::Logic and Kid::Logic::Disjoint), mathematical
model backend (Kid::MathModel), and mathematical
model solver (Kid::MathModel::Eval) are both implemented
and tested.

INSTALLATION

If what you have is a Kid release tarball, simply enter
the following commands to build/test/install Kid like
most CPAN modules:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Win32 users should use "nmake" instead of "make" in the
commands given above.

If you're working with a SVN copy of the Kid source,
you need to run the following command *before* you
enter the previous four commands:

	make -f Makefile.meta

Note that GNU-compatible make is required to process
Makefile.meta. It is known that nmake can't grok my
Makefile.meta. Sigh.

Since Kid depends on some other CPAN modules like
PerlMaple, Parse::RecDescent, and Language::AttributeGrammar.
So you should have these modules installed before
trying to install Kid.
