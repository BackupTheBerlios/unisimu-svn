= TODO List for the FAST Module

* Test as_png via GraphViz's as_debug method
* Added README.html to win32
* Test FAST tensely by evaluating the flowchart ASTs randomly
* Port FAST (and also its dependencies, Test::More, GraphViz, etc.) to Groovy
* Add detailed POD docs to every .pm file
* More robust Path env handling for Win32 FAST setup
* Merge FAST and FlowViz into one project
* Upload FAST to CPAN when it's ready
